# A Demo of services and named pipes.

# A multi-threaded service that simply echos back its input.

# * Install as a service using "pipeTestService.py install"
# * Use Control Panel to change the user name of the service
#   to a real user name (ie, NOT the SystemAccount)
# * Start the service.
# * Run the "pipeTestServiceClient.py" program as the client pipe side.

# Old versions of the service framework would not let you import this
# module at the top-level.  Now you can, and can check 'Debugging()' and
# 'RunningAsService()' to check your context.
