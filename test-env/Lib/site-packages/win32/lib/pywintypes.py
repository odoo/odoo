    # This has been through a number of iterations.  The problem: how to
    # locate pywintypesXX.dll when it may be in a number of places, and how
    # to avoid ever loading it twice.  This problem is compounded by the
    # fact that the "right" way to do this requires win32api, but this
    # itself requires pywintypesXX.
    # And the killer problem is that someone may have done 'import win32api'
    # before this code is called.  In that case Windows will have already
    # loaded pywintypesXX as part of loading win32api - but by the time
    # we get here, we may locate a different one.  This appears to work, but
    # then starts raising bizarre TypeErrors complaining that something
    # is not a pywintypes type when it clearly is!

    # So in what we hope is the last major iteration of this, we now
    # rely on a _win32sysloader module, implemented in C but not relying
    # on pywintypesXX.dll.  It then can check if the DLL we are looking for
    # lib is already loaded.
    # See if this is a debug build.
