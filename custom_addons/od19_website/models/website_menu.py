# must therefore be removed from the website header.
#
# They are matched by *URL* and not by *name*: the record name is translatable
# and is stored as "บล็อก" / "ติดต่อเรา" / "งาน" in a Thai database, so a
# name-based filter silently fails.  The URL is language independent and is
# also shared by the un-xmlided copies Odoo creates under the website's own top
# menu, so a single check catches both the template and the copy.
