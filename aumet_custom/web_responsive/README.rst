  combination instead of just ``Alt + [key]``.
  See https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/30068 to understand why.

  part for side-by-side reading instead of full screen. You can still put it on full
  width preview clicking on the new maximize button.

Usage
=====

The following keyboard shortcuts are implemented:

* Navigate app search results - Arrow keys
* Choose app result - ``Enter``
* ``Esc`` to close app drawer

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* To view the full experience in a device, the page must be loaded with the
  device screen size. This means that, if you change the size of your browser,
  you should reload the web client to get the full experience for that
  new size. This is Odoo's own limitation.
* App navigation with keyboard.
* Handle long titles on forms in a better way
* Standard sticky headers seems to not work properly on iOS Safari/Chrome (see #1626).
