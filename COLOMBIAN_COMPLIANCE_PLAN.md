# Colombian Compliance Review & Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document presents a gap analysis of the GPCB_Accounting system (Odoo v19) against
Colombian regulatory requirements for invoicing, tax reporting, and accounting standards.
The current `l10n_co` module provides foundational accounting data (Chart of Accounts,
tax definitions, identification types) but lacks critical compliance modules required by
DIAN and Colombian law. The most significant gap is the absence of an electronic invoicing
(facturacion electronica) module — a mandatory requirement for all Colombian taxpayers.

## 2. Detailed Gap Analysis

### 2.1 CRITICAL: Electronic Invoicing (Facturacion Electronica)

**Regulatory Requirement:**
All Colombian taxpayers selling goods or services subject to IVA or INC must issue
electronic invoices validated by DIAN before delivery to the buyer. Colombia operates
a clearance/pre-validation model — invoices must be transmitted to and approved by DIAN
in real time.

**Current State:**
- The codebase has no `l10n_co_edi` module
- Generic EDI infrastructure exists (`account_edi`, `account_edi_ubl_cii`) but is not
  adapted for Colombian DIAN requirements
- A field reference `l10n_co_edi_description_code_credit` exists in `l10n_co_pos` but
  is the only trace of Colombian EDI integration
- Other LATAM countries (Mexico, Chile) and European countries (Spain, Italy) have
  complete EDI modules that can serve as architectural references

**Impact:**
Without this module, invoices generated by the system **cannot be legally issued** in
Colombia. This is a non-negotiable compliance requirement.

**Required sub-components:**

1. **UBL 2.1 XML generation with DIAN extensions**
   - Invoice (Factura de Venta)
   - Credit Note (Nota Credito)
   - Debit Note (Nota Debito)
   - Namespace: `urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:schema:xsd:Invoice-2`
   - DIAN custom extension namespace for Colombian-specific fields

2. **CUFE generation (Clave Unica de Facturacion Electronica)**
   - Algorithm: SHA-384
   - Formula: `SHA384(NumFac + FecFac + ValFac + CodImp1 + ValImp1 + CodImp2 + ValImp2 + CodImp3 + ValImp3 + ValImp + NitOFE + NumAdq + ClTec + TipoAmbiente)`
   - Must be included in XML and printed on graphic representation
   - CUDE variant for credit/debit notes and equivalent documents

3. **DIAN web service integration**
   - SOAP/REST endpoints for invoice submission
   - Test environment: `vpfe-hab.dian.gov.co`
   - Production environment: `vpfe.dian.gov.co`
   - Synchronous validation response handling
   - Error code handling and retry logic
   - Status tracking per document

4. **Digital signature (XMLDSig)**
   - ONAC-accredited certificate management
   - RSA or ECDSA signing
   - SHA-256/SHA-384/SHA-512 hash algorithms
   - DIAN signing policy reference (`politicadefirmav2.pdf`)
   - Certificate upload, renewal tracking, expiration alerts

5. **QR code generation**
   - Mandatory on graphic representation (PDF)
   - Contains CUFE/CUDE and verification URL
   - Must follow DIAN specification

6. **DIAN-authorized numbering (Numeracion Autorizada)**
   - Configuration for authorized prefix/range per journal
   - Range validity period tracking
   - Alerts when approaching range exhaustion
   - Support for contingency numbering (talonario)

### 2.2 HIGH: Documento Equivalente Electronico (DEE)

**Regulatory Requirement:**
As of February-April 2025 (phased rollout), 13 types of equivalent documents must be
issued electronically and validated by DIAN. This affects public utilities, airlines,
financial institutions, and others.

**Current State:**
No support exists in the codebase.

**Required:**
- New document types extending `account.move` for DEE
- CUDE generation (same algorithm as CUFE but different parameters)
- Simplified buyer data handling (3 fields for POS per Res. 000202/2025)
- 48-hour transmission window for rural utilities

### 2.3 HIGH: Colombian Tax Reports

**Regulatory Requirement:**
Companies must file periodic tax returns with DIAN:
- Bimonthly IVA returns (Declaracion de IVA)
- Monthly withholding returns (Declaracion de Retencion en la Fuente)
- Annual income tax return
- ICA returns (municipal, varies by city)
- Exogenous information (Informacion Exogena) - annual third-party reporting

**Current State:**
- A report menu entry exists (`account_chart_template_data.xml`) but no actual report
  definitions or templates specific to Colombia
- The generic `account.report` framework supports creating country-specific reports
  with tag-based tax mapping, but no Colombian reports are defined

**Required:**
- IVA return report (Formulario 300)
- Withholding return report (Formulario 350)
- Withholding certificates (Certificados de Retencion) per Art. 381 E.T.
- ICA return report template
- Tax tag mapping on all Colombian taxes for report aggregation
- Exogenous information XML generation (Formato 1001, 1003, 1005, etc.)

### 2.4 HIGH: Withholding Certificates

**Regulatory Requirement:**
Withholding agents must deliver annual certificates to suppliers by March 31 of the
following year. Monthly certificates are also common practice.

**Current State:**
- The withholding tax framework exists (`l10n_account_withholding_tax`)
- Tax definitions for RteFte, RteIVA, RteICA are present
- No certificate generation or PDF template exists

**Required:**
- Withholding certificate model and report
- PDF template matching DIAN format
- Aggregation of withholdings by period, partner, and tax type
- Delivery tracking

### 2.5 MEDIUM: UVT Management

**Regulatory Requirement:**
The UVT (Unidad de Valor Tributario) changes annually (COP $52,374 for 2026). Many
tax thresholds are expressed in UVT, including withholding minimums.

**Current State:**
No UVT tracking mechanism exists. All tax computations use fixed percentages without
threshold-based triggering.

**Required:**
- UVT configuration model (value per year)
- Threshold-based withholding tax computation (e.g., RteFte on purchases applies only
  when base exceeds 10 UVT = COP $523,740 for 2026)
- Annual update mechanism

### 2.6 MEDIUM: Fiscal Position Rules

**Regulatory Requirement:**
Different tax treatment applies depending on the partner type:
- Gran Contribuyente (large taxpayer)
- Autorretenedor (self-withholding agent)
- Regimen Comun vs Regimen Simple
- Persona Natural declarante vs no declarante
- Foreign suppliers

**Current State:**
- The generic fiscal position framework exists in the `account` module
- No pre-configured Colombian fiscal positions are defined

**Required:**
- Fiscal position definitions for common Colombian partner classifications
- Tax mapping rules (e.g., when selling to a Gran Contribuyente, different
  withholding rates apply)
- Partner fields for Colombian tax classification
- Automatic fiscal position assignment based on partner type

### 2.7 MEDIUM: Self-Withholding (Autorretencion)

**Regulatory Requirement:**
Certain companies designated by DIAN must self-withhold (autorretencion sobre la renta)
on their sales income at 0.4%, 0.8%, or 1.6% depending on the activity.

**Current State:**
No support. The withholding framework only handles withholding on purchases.

**Required:**
- Self-withholding tax definitions
- Integration with sales invoicing workflow
- Automatic computation based on company designation

### 2.8 MEDIUM: Tax Rate and Threshold Updates for 2026

**Regulatory Requirement:**
Decreto 0572 de 2025 modified several withholding thresholds effective June 1, 2025.
The UVT for 2026 is COP $52,374 (Res. 000238/2025).

**Current State:**
- Tax rates in `account.tax-co.csv` appear to reflect rates from around 2017-2020
- Some legacy rates exist (16% IVA from 2016)
- No threshold-based withholding logic

**Items to update:**
- Verify all RteFte rates against current Decreto 0572/2025
- Add threshold-based withholding computation using UVT
- Mark legacy taxes (16% IVA from 2016) as inactive by default
- Verify RteICA rates against Bogota and other major municipalities
- Add RteVAT 100% rate for certain operations

### 2.9 LOW: RADIAN Support

**Regulatory Requirement:**
Electronic invoices can be used as negotiable instruments (titulos valores) through
DIAN's RADIAN system. Each event requires additional digital signatures.

**Current State:**
No support exists.

**Required (future phase):**
- RADIAN event registration
- Additional signature handling
- Title transfer tracking

### 2.10 LOW: NIIF/IFRS Reporting Reconciliation

**Regulatory Requirement:**
Colombian companies must maintain accounting records under NIIF (IFRS) and reconcile
with tax-basis accounting for DIAN filings.

**Current State:**
- The generic ledger group feature supports multiple accounting standards
- No Colombian-specific NIIF reconciliation is configured

**Required (future phase):**
- Pre-configured ledger groups for NIIF vs fiscal accounting
- Tax-to-IFRS reconciliation report
- Guidance documentation for setup

## 4. Architecture Considerations

### 4.1 Module dependencies

```
l10n_co_edi
  ├── l10n_co (Chart of Accounts, taxes, identification types)
  ├── account_edi (generic EDI framework)
  ├── account_edi_ubl_cii (UBL 2.1 base templates)
  ├── l10n_latam_invoice_document (LATAM document types)
  └── l10n_account_withholding_tax (withholding on payment)

l10n_co_reports (new)
  ├── l10n_co (base)
  └── account_reports (report framework - if available, or account)

l10n_co_edi_dee (new, optional)
  ├── l10n_co_edi
  └── point_of_sale (for POS tickets)
```

### 4.2 Reference implementations

The following existing modules provide proven patterns to follow:

| Module | Relevance |
|--------|-----------|
| `l10n_es_edi_facturae` | Spanish e-invoicing with XML signing, government submission |
| `l10n_it_edi` | Italian e-invoicing with clearance model (similar to Colombia) |
| `l10n_my_edi` | Malaysian e-invoicing with UBL 2.1 and government API |
| `l10n_mx` | Mexican CFDI — closest LATAM equivalent with SAT integration |
| `account_edi_ubl_cii` | Base UBL/CII templates to extend |
| `account_peppol` | EDI proxy architecture for government submission |

### 4.3 Security considerations

- Digital certificate private keys must be encrypted at rest
- DIAN credentials (software PIN) stored in system parameters, not in code
- Audit logging for all DIAN submissions
- Hash chain integrity for sequential invoice numbering (already supported by Odoo)

### 4.4 Testing strategy

- Unit tests for CUFE/CUDE computation with known test vectors
- XML validation against DIAN XSD schemas
- Integration tests with DIAN test environment (habilitacion)
- End-to-end tests: invoice creation -> XML generation -> signing -> mock DIAN response
- Tax computation tests for all withholding scenarios

## 5. Priority Matrix

| Phase | Priority | Effort | Business Impact |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Phase 1: Foundation | P0 | Medium | Enables all subsequent work |
| Phase 2: XML & Signing | P0 | High | Required for legal invoicing |
| Phase 3: DIAN Integration | P0 | High | Required for legal invoicing |
| Phase 4: Reporting | P1 | Medium | Required for tax filing |
| Phase 5: Fiscal Positions | P1 | Low-Medium | Reduces manual errors |
| Phase 6: DEE | P1 | Medium | Required for POS and utilities |
| Phase 7: Exogenous Info | P2 | Medium | Annual filing requirement |

**Phases 1-3 are mandatory for legal operation in Colombia.**
Phases 4-5 are required for periodic compliance.
Phases 6-7 can be deferred depending on business type.

---

## 6. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| DIAN Technical Annex version change | Medium | High | Design XML templates for easy version updates; monitor DIAN resolutions |
| Digital certificate compatibility | Medium | Medium | Test with multiple ONAC-accredited providers (Certicamara, Andes SCD, GSE) |
| DIAN web service downtime | High | Medium | Implement contingency mode with offline numbering |
| Tax rate changes mid-year | High | Low | UVT-based thresholds; configurable tax rates; migration scripts |
| Constitutional challenge to Decreto 1474 | Medium | Low | Design tax rules to be easily toggled |
| Performance impact of XML generation | Low | Medium | Async processing; batch submission support |

---

## 7. Regulatory Calendar

| Date | Obligation | Relevance |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Monthly (varies) | IVA return (bimonthly for most; monthly for large taxpayers) | Phase 4 |
| Monthly | Withholding return (Formulario 350) | Phase 4 |
| March 31, 2026 | Withholding certificates for TY 2025 | Phase 4 |
| April-June 2026 | Annual income tax return (dates vary by NIT) | Phase 4 |
| March-April 2026 | Exogenous information submission | Phase 7 |
| Ongoing | Electronic invoice issuance per transaction | Phases 1-3 |
| Ongoing | Documento equivalente electronico | Phase 6 |
| July 31, 2026 | Tax normalization (Decreto 1474) | Informational |

---

## 8. Summary of Recommendations

1. **Immediate priority:** Begin Phase 1-3 development of `l10n_co_edi` module. Without
   electronic invoicing, the system cannot be legally used for invoicing in Colombia.

2. **Leverage existing architecture:** The `account_edi` and `account_edi_ubl_cii` modules
   provide a solid foundation. Italy's clearance model (`l10n_it_edi`) is the closest
   architectural match to Colombia's pre-validation requirement.

3. **Tax data maintenance:** Establish a process for annual tax rate and UVT updates.
   Current tax data should be audited against 2026 regulations.

4. **Test with DIAN:** Register for DIAN's test environment (habilitacion) early to
   validate XML format and web service integration before production deployment.

5. **Phased rollout:** Implement the 7 phases sequentially, with Phases 1-3 as the
   minimum viable product for Colombian compliance.
