Contributing to Odoo
====================

[Full contribution guidelines](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Contributing)

TL;DR

* If you [make a pull request](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Contributing#making-pull-requests),
  do not create an issue! Use the PR description for that
* Issues are handled with a much lower priority than pull requests
* Use this [template](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Contributing#reporting-issues)
  when reporting issues. Please search for duplicates first!
* Pull requests must be made against the [correct version](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Contributing#against-which-version-should-i-submit-a-patch)
* There are restrictions on the kind of [changes allowed in stable series](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Contributing#what-does-stable-mean)

**Little recent activity & sparsely documented issue**
```
Hi, is this still an issue? There has been little activity on this issue lately.

@ISSUEPOSTER If you feel, this is rather configuration, than a code issue, you might consider closing this. Else, I would suggest, to elaborate your description, to make it as convenient as possible for other volunteers to reproduce this exact error on their computers. This is an importent fist step to improve your chances of getting this solved.
