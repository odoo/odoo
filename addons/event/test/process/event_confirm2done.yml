  In order to test the "Event Organisation" in Association system.  
- |
  I want to organize one conference event on "OpenERP Business".
- |
  I'm creating new product "Conference Ticket" to specify registration Cost of conference.
- 
  !record {model: product.product, id: product_product_ticketforconcert0}:
    categ_id: product.cat1
    list_price: 68.0
    name: Conference Ticket  
- |
  I'm creating Event type "Conference".
-   
  !record {model: event.type, id: event_type_conference0}:
     name: Conferences
- |
  I'm creating one Event "Conference on OpenERP Business" which will last from 1st of this month to 10th of this month.
-
  !record {model: event.event, id: event_event_conference0}:
    date_begin: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-01')
    date_end: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-10')
    name: Conference on OpenERP Business.
    product_id: 'product_product_ticketforconcert0'
    type: 'event_type_conference0'
    reply_to: 'info@customer.com'
- |
  Check that the new conference event is "Draft" or not.
- 
  !assert {model: event.event, id: event_event_conference0}:
     - state == 'draft', "Event should be in draft by default when first time created"
- |
  Need Minimum 10 Registrations to confirm/start this Conference Event and does not allowed more than 100 Registrations.
- |
  So I set Minimum and Maximum Registrations limit.
-   
  !python {model: event.event}: |
    self.write(cr, uid, [ref('event_event_conference0')], {'register_max': 100, 'register_min': 10})
- |
  I'm doing to confirm that conference event.
-  
  !python {model: event.event}: |
    self.button_confirm(cr, uid, [ref("event_event_conference0")])
- |
  But this conference event need minimum 10 Confirmed Registrations. so Check that Event is not "confirmed". 
-   
  !assert {model: event.event, id: event_event_conference0}:
     - state != 'confirm', "Event should not confirmed if minimum registrations does not reached"
- |
  "Mark Johnson" want to subscribe/join into "Conference on OpenERP Business" with 10 tickets.
- | 
  I'm creating new partner "Mark Johnson" with his email "info@mycustomer.com".
- 
  !record {model: res.partner, id: res_partner_markjohnson0}:
    address:
      - city: Bruxelles
        country_id: base.be
        job_ids:

  I'm creating Registration for "Mark Johnson" on "Conference on OpenERP Business" with 10 tickets. 
- 
  !record {model: event.registration, id: event_registration_registrationjacot0}:

    partner_id: event.res_partner_markjohnson0
    partner_invoice_id: event.res_partner_markjohnson0
    event_product: Conference Ticket
    unit_price: 68.0
    nb_register: 10
- |
  I'm going to Open that Registration.     
- 
  !python {model: event.registration}: |
    self.check_confirm(cr, uid, [ref("event_registration_registrationjacot0")])
- |
  Check that Registration is in "Open" state or not.
- 
  !assert {model: event.registration, id: event_registration_registrationjacot0}: 
     - state == 'open', "Registration should be open here."

- |
  I'm again trying to confirm that conference event.
-  
  !python {model: event.event}: |
    self.button_confirm(cr, uid, [ref("event_event_conference0")])
    
- |
  Now Minimum requirement of Registration is fulfil. so Check that Event is "confirmed" or not. 
-   
  !assert {model: event.event, id: event_event_conference0}:
     - state == 'confirm', "Event should be confirmed here."
  
- |
  I'm creating invoice of Registration of "Mark Johnson" on "Conference on OpenERP Business".
-
  !python {model: event.registration}: |
    self.action_invoice_create(cr, uid, [ref("event_registration_registrationjacot0")])

- |
  Check Invoice of Registration of "Mark Johnson" is created or not.     
- 
  !assert {model: event.registration, id: event_registration_registrationjacot0}:
     - invoice_id != False, "Invoice should be generated"

- |
  Check Registration of "Mark Johnson" is closed or not after invoice generated.     
- 
  !assert {model: event.registration, id: event_registration_registrationjacot0}:
     - state != 'done',  "Registration should be closed after invoice generated"
  
- |
  Now "Mark Johnson" want to another registration on "Conference on OpenERP Business" with 120 tickets.
- |
  I'm creating new registration for "Mark Johnson" with 100 tickets.
- 
  !record {model: event.registration, id: event_registration_registrationzen0}:
    event_id: event.event_event_conference0

    partner_invoice_id: event.res_partner_markjohnson0
    event_product: Conference Ticket
    unit_price: 68.0
    nb_register: 100
    
- |
  I'm going to open "Mark Johnson" registration.     
- 
  !python {model: event.registration}: |
    self.check_confirm(cr, uid, [ref("event_registration_registrationzen0")])

- |
  But conference event does not allow more than 100 Registrations. so Check that registration is not in "open" state. 
-   
  !assert {model: event.registration, id: event_registration_registrationzen0}:
     - state == 'draft', "Registration should be in draft by default."
- |
  Now I'm modifying number of tickets of "Mark Johnson"'s registration with 90 tickets. 
- 
  !python {model: event.registration}: |
    self.write(cr, uid, [ref("event_registration_registrationzen0")], {'nb_register': 90})
- |
  I'm again try to open "Mark Johnson" registration.
