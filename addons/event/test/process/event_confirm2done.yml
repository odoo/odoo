  I want to organize one conference event on "OpenERP Business", Customer subscribe/join 
  into "Conference on OpenERP Business" with 6 tickets, first I confim this event. 
-
  !python {model: event.event}: |
    self.button_confirm(cr, uid, [ref("event_0")])
-
  I Check that Event is "confirmed", and Its automatically sending mail to registered 
  partner which joined to this event.
-
  !assert {model: event.event, id: event_0}:
    - state == 'confirm', "Event should be confirmed."
-
  After completed event, I close this event.
-
  !python {model: event.event}: |
    self.button_done(cr, uid, [ref("event_0")])
-
  Check that conference is in "close" state. 
-
  !assert {model: event.event, id: event_0}:
    - state == 'done', "Event should be Closed."
