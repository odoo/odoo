Create workflows with more or less automatization and apply it on sales
orders.

A workflow can:

- Apply default values:

  * Shipping Policy (Deliver each product when available or Deliver all products at once)
  * Set the invoice's date to the sale order's date
  * Set a sales team

- Apply automatic actions:

  * Validate the order (only if paid, always, never)
  * Send order confirmation mail (only when order confirmed)
  * Create an invoice
  * Validate the invoice
  * Send the invoice via e-mail
  * Confirm the picking
