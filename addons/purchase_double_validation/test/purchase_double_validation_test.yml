  I Create new limit amount from Configure Limit Amount for Purchase wizard.
-
  !record {model: purchase.double.validation.installer, id: purchase_double_validation_installer_1}:
    limit_amount: 3000
-
  I set the Limit Amount.
-
  !python {model: purchase.double.validation.installer}: |
    self.execute(cr, uid, [ref("purchase_double_validation_installer_1")])
-
  I Test for purchase double validation in which Total > = Limit Amount.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    installer_amount = self.pool.get('purchase.double.validation.installer').browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_double_validation_installer_1"))
    purchase_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("order_purchase11"))
    assert purchase_order.amount_total >= installer_amount.limit_amount ,"Total is Less then the Limit Amount"
-
  In order to test the flow, I confirmed the purchase order.
-
  !workflow {model: purchase.order, action: purchase_confirm, ref: order_purchase11}
-
  I check that the order which was initially in the draft state has transmit to confirm state for double validation.
-
  !assert {model: purchase.order, id: order_purchase11, severity: error, string: Purchase Order should be in Confirmed state.}:
    - state == 'confirmed'
-
  I Approved the purchase order.
-
  !workflow {model: purchase.order, action: purchase_approve, ref: order_purchase11}
-
  I check that the order which was initially in the confirmed state has transmit to approved state.
-
  !assert {model: purchase.order, id: order_purchase11, severity: error, string: Purchase Order should be in Approved state.}:
    - state == 'approved'
-
  Test for purchase double validation in which Total < = Limit Amount.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    installer_amount = self.pool.get('purchase.double.validation.installer').browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_double_validation_installer_1"))
    purchase_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("order_purchase12"))
    assert purchase_order.amount_total <= installer_amount.limit_amount ,"Total is Greater then the Limit Amount"
-
  I confirmed the purchase order of amount of less than Limit amount.
-
  !workflow {model: purchase.order, action: purchase_confirm, ref: order_purchase12}
-
  I check that the order is in approved state.
-
  !assert {model: purchase.order, id: order_purchase12, severity: error, string: Purchase Order should be in Approved state.}:
    - state == 'approved'
