With this module, the WebDAV server for documents is activated.
===============================================================

You can then use any compatible browser to remotely see the attachments of OpenObject.

After installation, the WebDAV server can be controlled by a [webdav] section in 
the server's config.

Server Configuration Parameter:
-------------------------------
[webdav]:
+++++++++ 
    * enable = True ; Serve webdav over the http(s) servers
    * vdir = webdav ; the directory that webdav will be served at
    * this default val means that webdav will be
    * on "http://localhost:8069/webdav/
    * verbose = True ; Turn on the verbose messages of webdav
    * debug = True ; Turn on the debugging messages of webdav
    * since the messages are routed to the python logging, with
    * levels "debug" and "debug_rpc" respectively, you can leave
    * these options on

Also implements IETF RFC 5785 for services discovery on a http server,
which needs explicit configuration in openerp-server.conf too.
