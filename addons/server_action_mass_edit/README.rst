This module provides the following features:

* You can add, update or remove the values of more than one records on the fly at the same time.

* You can configure mass editing for any Odoo model.

**Difference between the Odoo 13.0 CE Feature**

Since Odoo V13, a limited "mass Editing feature" is available in Odoo CE.

This module provides the following extra features that are not in the Core
for the time being:

* Possibility to mass edit many fields in a single action
* Possibility to add a group to limit the usage of this function to given
  people
* Possibility to filter the items the user can mass update
* Possibility to mass edit any fields with any widget. (For exemple
  color fields, image fields, etc...)

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

* *Add Action*: Click on *Create Contextual Action* to add mass editing in *Action* menu.


**Options**

  the mass editing action with a domain.

Usage
