    picking_obj = self.pool.get('stock.picking')
    picking = picking_obj.browse(cr, uid, [ref('stock_picking_out0')], context=context)
    partner = picking[0].partner_id.id
    inv_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('type','=','out_invoice'),('partner_id','=',partner)], context=context)
    assert inv_ids, 'No Invoice is generated!'
