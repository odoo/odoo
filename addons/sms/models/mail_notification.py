    # Though this is an interesting case:
    # On sms.resend.recipient, partner_id depends on mail.notification.partner_id as it is defined as a related
    # fields.Many2one('res.partner', 'Partner', related='notification_id.res_partner_id', readonly=True)
    # The below is to add an inverse to the many2one sms.resend.recipient.notification_id
    # so it maintains a list of sms.resend.recipient.partner_id to invalidate
    # when modifying the partner_id of mail.notification. Otherwise the ORM has to do a plain search to find the sms.resend.recipient
    # which have as notification id the one that has been modified
    # Though:
    #  - We already discussed the matter it would rather be more interesting to do this automatically for these cases,
    #    with a kind of virtual one2many the developer/user doesn't know about,
    #    so the developer doesnt have to create it himself for this technical/performance reason
    #  - In this case, the modified happens on the creation of the mail.notification, and has it has just been created it
    #    would be quite safe to assume there was no `sms.resend.recipient` and we could have avoided the search,
    #    even without this virtual/technical one2many.
