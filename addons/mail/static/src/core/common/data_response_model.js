 * request. It basically does the un-batching by referencing the given id. The rest of the data
 * being grouped together in the store, flattened and with no duplicate records/fields, no matter
 * how many requests are returning the same data.
 * Instances of the class are created by the fetch method on each call, and they are deleted once
 * they are resolved with their data. This class should not be used directly under typical use.
