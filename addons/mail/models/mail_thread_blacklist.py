    """ Mixin that is inherited by all model with opt out. This mixin stores a normalized
    email based on primary_email field.

    A normalized email is considered as :
        - having a left part + @ + a right part (the domain can be without '.something')
        - being lower case
        - having no name before the address. Typically, having no 'Name <>'
    Ex:
        - Formatted Email : 'Name <NaMe@DoMaIn.CoM>'
        - Normalized Email : 'name@domain.com'

    The primary email field can be specified on the parent model, if it differs from the default one ('email')
    The email_normalized field can than be used on that model to search quickly on emails (by simple comparison
    and not using time consuming regex anymore).

    Using this email_normalized field, blacklist status is computed.

    Mail Thread capabilities are required for this mixin. """
