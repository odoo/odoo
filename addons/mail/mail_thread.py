       act as a discussion topic on which messages can be attached.
       Public methods are prefixed with ``message_`` in order to avoid
       name collisions with methods of the models that will inherit
       from this mixin.

       ``mail.thread`` adds a one2many of mail.messages, acting as the
       thread's history, and a few methods that may be overridden to
       implement model-specific behavior upon arrival of new messages.

       Inheriting classes are not required to implement any method, as the
       default implementation will work for any model. However it is common
       to override at least the ``message_new`` and ``message_update``
       methods (calling ``super``) to add model-specific behavior at
       creation and update of a thread.
