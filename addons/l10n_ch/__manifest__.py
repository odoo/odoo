Swiss localization
==================
This module defines a chart of account for Switzerland (Swiss PME/KMU 2015), taxes and enables the generation of ISR and QR-bill when you print an invoice or send it by mail.

An ISR will be generated if you specify the information it needs :
    - The bank account you expect to be paid on must be set, and have a valid postal reference.
    - Your invoice must have been set assigned a bank account to receive its payment
      (this can be done manually, but a default value is automatically set if you have defined a bank account).
    - You must have set the postal references of your bank.
    - Your invoice must be in EUR or CHF (as ISRs do not accept other currencies)

A QR-bill will be generated if:
    - The partner set on your invoice has a complete address (street, city, postal code and country) in Switzerland
    - The option to generate the Swiss QR-code is selected on the invoice (done by default)
    - A correct account number/QR IBAN is set on your bank journal
    - (when using a QR-IBAN): the payment reference of the invoice is a QR-reference

The generation of the ISR and QR-bill is automatic if you meet the previous criteria.

Here is how it works:
    - Printing the invoice will trigger the download of three files: the invoice, its ISR and its QR-bill
    - Clicking the 'Send by mail' button will attach three files to your draft mail : the invoice, the ISR and the QR-bill.
