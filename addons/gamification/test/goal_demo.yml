  In order to test process of the Goals, I assign the discovery goal plan to all users
-
  !record {model: gamification.goal.plan, id: plan_base_discover}:
    autojoin_group_id: base.group_user
-
  I verify that the users of the group are added (at least admin and demo)
-
  !assert {model: gamification.goal.plan, id: plan_base_discover, string: The autojoin function was not successful}:
    - len(user_ids) >= 2
-
  I start the goal plan and verify the change of state
-
  !python {model: gamification.goal.plan}: |
    plan = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('plan_base_discover'))
    self.action_start(cr, uid, [plan.id], context=context)
    assert plan.state == 'inprogress', "Plan failed the change of state"
-
  I verify the goals are generated correctly
-
  !python {model: gamification.goal}: |
    goal_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('plan_id', '=', ref('plan_base_discover'))], context=context)
    assert len(goal_ids) >= 4, "Not enough goals have been generated"
    for goal in self.browse(cr, uid, goal_ids, context=context):
      assert goal.state != 'draft', "Draft goal have been generated"
      assert goal.planline_id.plan_id.id == ref('plan_base_discover'), "Linked planline incorrect"
-
  I change timezone for demo user
-
  !record {model: res.users, id: base.user_demo}:
    tz: "Europe/Brussels"
-
  I check the goal for demo user is successful
-
  !python {model: gamification.goal}: |
    goal_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('user_id', '=', ref('base.user_demo')),('type_id','=',ref('type_base_timezone'))])
    self.update(cr, uid, goal_ids, context=context)
    for goal in self.browse(cr, uid, goal_ids, context=context):
      assert goal.state == "reached", "Goal not successful %s" % goal.state
-
  I add a reward to the challenge
-
  !record {model: gamification.goal.plan, id: plan_base_discover}:
    reward_first_id: gamification.badge_good_job
    reward_failure: True
-
  I check the demo user received the badge
-
  !python {model: gamification.goal.plan}: |
    plan = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('plan_base_discover'), context=context)
    self.action_close(cr, uid, [plan.id])
    badge_ids = self.pool.get('gamification.badge.user').search(cr, uid, [('badge_id', '=', ref('badge_good_job')), ('user_id', '=', ref('base.user_demo'))])
    assert badge_ids, "Demo users didn't received the badge"
