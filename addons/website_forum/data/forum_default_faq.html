<h2><a class="faq-question">What kinds of questions can I ask here?</a></h2>
<p>
    This community is for professional and enthusiast users,
    partners and programmers. You can ask questions about:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>how to install Odoo on a specific infrastructure,</li>
    <li>how to configure or customize Odoo to specific business needs,</li>
    <li>what's the best way to use Odoo for a specific business need,</li>
    <li>how to develop modules for your own need,</li>
    <li>specific questions about Odoo service offers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Before you ask - please make sure to search for a similar question.</b> You can
    search questions by their title or tags.  It’s also OK to
    answer your own question.
</p><p>
    <b>Please avoid asking questions that are too subjective
    and argumentative</b> or not relevant to this community.
</p>
<h2><a class="faq-question">What should I avoid in my questions?</a></h2>
<p>
    You should only ask practical, answerable questions based
    on actual problems that you face. Chatty, open-ended
    questions diminish the usefulness of this site and push
    other questions off the front page.
</p><p>
    To prevent your question from being flagged and possibly removed, avoid asking
    subjective questions where …
</p>
<ul>
    <li>every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?”</li>
    <li>your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”</li>
    <li>there is no actual problem to be solved: “I’m curious if other people feel like I do.”</li>
    <li>we are being asked an open-ended, hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”</li>
    <li>it is a rant disguised as a question: “______ sucks, am I right?”</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you fit in one of these example or if your motivation for asking the
    question is “I would like to participate in a discussion about ______”, then
    you should not be asking here but on our mailing lists.
    However, if your motivation is “I would like others to explain ______ to me”,
    then you are probably OK.

<ul>
    <li><b>Answers should not add or expand questions</b>. Instead either edit the question or add a question comment.</li>
    <li><b>Answers should not comment other answers</b>. Instead add a comment on the other answers.</li>
    <li><b>Answers shouldn't just point to other Questions</b>. Instead add a question comment indication "Possible duplicate of...". However, it's ok to include links to other questions or answers providing relevant additional information.</li>
    <li><b>Answers shouldn't just provide a link a solution</b>. Instead provide the solution description text in your answer, even if it's just a copy/paste. Links are welcome, but should be complementary to answer, referring sources or additional reading.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="faq-question">What should I avoid in my answers?</a></h2>

    <b>Answers should not add or expand questions</b>. Instead
    either edit the question or add a comment.
</p><p>
    <b>Answers should not comment other answers</b>. Instead
    add a comment on the other answers.
</p><p>
    <b>Answers shouldn't just point to other questions</b>.
    Instead add a comment indicating <i>"Possible duplicate
    of..."</i>. However, it's fine to include links to other
    questions or answers providing relevant additional
    information. </p> <p> <b>Answers shouldn't just provide a
    link a solution</b>. Instead provide the solution
    description text in your answer, even if it's just a
    copy/paste. Links are welcome, but should be complementary to
    answer, referring sources or additional reading.
</p><p>
    <b>Answers should not start debates</b>
    This community Q&amp;A is not a discussion group. Please avoid holding debates in
    your answers as they tend to dilute the essence of questions and answers. For
    brief discussions please use commenting facility.
</p> <p>
    When a question or answer is upvoted, the user who posted them will gain some
    points, which are called "karma points". These points serve as a rough
    measure of the community trust to him/her. Various moderation tasks are
    gradually assigned to the users based on those points.
</p> <p>
    For example, if you ask an interesting question or give a helpful answer, your
    input will be upvoted. On the other hand if the answer is misleading - it will
    be downvoted. Each vote in favor will generate 10 points, each vote against
    will subtract 10 points. There is a limit of 200 points that can be accumulated
    for a question or answer per day. The table given at the end explains reputation point
    requirements for each type of moderation task.

<h2><a class="faq-question">Why can other people edit my questions/answers?</a></h2>
<p>
    The goal of this site is create a relevant knowledge base that would answer
    questions related to Odoo.
</p><p>
    Therefore questions and answers can be edited like wiki pages by experienced users of
    this site in order to improve the overall quality of the knowledge base content.
    Such privileges are granted based on user karma level: you will be able to do the same
    once your karma gets high enough.
</p><p>
    If this approach is not for you, please respect the community and use Google+
    communities instead.
