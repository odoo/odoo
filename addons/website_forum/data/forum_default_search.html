	<h2>How do I search?</h2>
	<div id="help-post-body">
		<p>Enter search terms in the search box that appears in the upper right corner of every page, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>

		<p>If you need to refine and narrow your search, here are some basic tips:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>To search within specific tag(s), enter them in square brackets: <code>[python] html</code> searches for mentions of "html" within the [python] tag. </li>
			<li>To find a specific phrase, or to search a string of special characters, enter it in quotes: like <code>"ERP and eCommerce"</code>.</li>
			<li>To search <em>User</em> posts: <code>user:&lt;user_id> training</code> searches all of user posts for the word "training".</li>
			<li>To <em>exclude</em> results from a tag, term or phrase, prefix it with <code>-</code> in your query: <code>[python] -[css]</code> includes only posts having python tag and exclude posts which having css tag. </li>
		</ul>

		<h2> Advanced Search Options:</h2>

		<p>We offer a number of advanced search operators to help you find very specific information.</p>

		<h3>Range Operators</h3>

		<p>To search for only questions that fall within a particular range for <strong>score</strong>, number of <strong>answers</strong>, or number of <strong>views</strong>, you can enter an upper or lower parameter, or a range.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><code>score:-1</code> will both return posts with a score greater than or equal to -1</li>
			<li><code>views:500</code> will return posts with a views greater than or equal to 500</li>
			<li><code>answers:3</code> will return questions with a answer greater than or equal to 3</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>User Operators</h3>

		<p>You can also limit searches to a specific user's content (your own or someone else's). You will need the user id to search user's posts.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><code>user:&lt;user_id></code>returns only the posts from whichever user whose id you entered</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>OR operator</h3>

		<p>To combine results from multiple tags, separate the tag names (enclosed in square brackets) with the word "or": <code>[python] or [html]</code> returns questions tagged with <em>either</em> tag.</p>
