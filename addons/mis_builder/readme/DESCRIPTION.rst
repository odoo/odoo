This module allows you to build Management Information Systems dashboards.
Such style of reports presents KPI in rows and time periods in columns.
Reports mainly fetch data from account moves, but can also combine data coming
from arbitrary Odoo models. Reports can be exported to PDF, Excel and they
can be added to Odoo dashboards.
