Modified imports to be compatible, otherwise the code is the same as v2.0.0
https://github.com/duo-labs/py_webauthn/releases/tag/v2.0.0

We were not able to add the package to our requirements for the following reasons:
- Their requirements.txt required pyOpenSSL 23.3.0, which is not compatible with our requirements.
- The package is not in the debian apt repositories.
