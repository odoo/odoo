**Features for desktop computers**:

- Keyboard shortcuts for easier navigation, **using \`Alt + Shift +
  \[NUM\]\`** combination instead of just Alt + \[NUM\] to avoid
  conflict with Firefox Tab switching. Standard Odoo keyboard hotkeys
  changed to be more intuitive or accessible by fingers of one hand.
  F.x. Alt + S for Save
