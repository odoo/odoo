/** @odoo-module alias=web.AbstractModel **/

/**
 * An AbstractModel is the M in MVC.  We tend to think of MVC more on the server
 * side, but we are talking here on the web client side.
 *
 * The duties of the Model are to fetch all relevant data, and to make them
 * available for the rest of the view.  Also, every modification to that data
 * should pass through the model.
 *
 * Note that the model is not a widget, it does not need to be rendered or
 * appended to the dom.  However, it inherits from the EventDispatcherMixin,
 * in order to be able to notify its parent by bubbling events up.
 *
 * The model is able to generate sample (fake) data when there is no actual data
 * in database.  This feature can be activated by instantiating the model with
 * param "useSampleModel" set to true.  In this case, the model instantiates a
 * duplicated version of itself, parametrized to call a SampleServer (JS)
 * instead of doing RPCs.  Here is how it works: the main model first load the
 * data normally (from database), and then checks whether the result is empty or
 * not.  If it is, it asks the sample model to load with the exact same params,
 * and it thus enters in "sample" mode.  The model keeps doing this at reload,
 * but only if the (re)load params haven't changed: as soon as a param changes,
 * the "sample" mode is left, and it never enters it again in the future (in the
 * lifetime of the model instance).  To access those sample data from the outside,
 * 'get' must be called with the option "withSampleData" set to true.  In
 * this case, if the main model is in "sample" mode, it redirects the call to the
 * sample model.
