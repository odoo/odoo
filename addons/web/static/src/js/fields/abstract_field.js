/**
 * This is the basic field widget used by all the views to render a field in a view.
 * These field widgets are mostly common to all views, in particular form and list
 * views.
 *
 * The responsabilities of a field widget are mainly:
 * - render a visual representation of the current value of a field
 * - that representation is either in 'readonly' or in 'edit' mode
 * - notify the rest of the system when the field has been changed by
 *   the user (in edit mode)
 *
 * Notes
 * - the widget is not supposed to be able to switch between modes.  If another
 *   mode is required, the view will take care of instantiating another widget.
 * - notify the system when its value has changed and its mode is changed to 'readonly'
 * - notify the system when some action has to be taken, such as opening a record
 * - the Field widget should not, ever, under any circumstance, be aware of
 *   its parent.  The way it communicates changes with the rest of the system is by
 *   triggering events (with trigger_up).  These events bubble up and are interpreted
 *   by the most appropriate parent.
 *
 * Also, in some cases, it may not be practical to have the same widget for all
 * views. In that situation, you can have a 'view specific widget'.  Just register
 * the widget in the registry prefixed by the view type and a dot.  So, for example,
 * a form specific many2one widget should be registered as 'form.many2one'.
