 * We define here the generic notion of Action (from the point of view of the
 * web client).  In short, an action is a widget which controls the main part
 * of the screen (everything below the control panel).
 *
 * More precisely, the action manager is the component that coordinates a stack
 * of actions.  Whenever the user navigates in the interface, switches views,
 * open different menus, the action manager creates/updates/destroys special
 * widgets which are actions.  These actions need to answer to a standardised
 * API, which is the reason for this AbstractAction class.
 *
 * In practice, most actions are view controllers (coming from a
 * ir.action.act_window).  However, some actions are 'client actions'.  They
 * also need to be an AbstractAction for a better cooperation with the action
 * manager.
