// This file is importing bootstrap. While a simple "import "bootstrap";"
// should be enough, this does not allow overridding mixins. Overridding mixins
// is necessary for some of our need and allow to generate more efficient CSS
// than adding more rules. This file instead copies the first part of the
// content of the "bootstrap.scss" files to allow adding mixin overrides in
// between.
