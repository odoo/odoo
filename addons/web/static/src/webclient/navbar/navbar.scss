// = Main Navbar
//

// The MainNavbar design is shared with the frontent and, at the current state,
// backend owl components coexist with legacy ones in the backend too.
// In order to limit unnecessary code repetition and fragmantation, all main
// design rules are located in legacy/scss/navbar.scss.
// Moreover, if a new design rule is needed for the backend *only*, it can be
// added here.
