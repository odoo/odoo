# Date Range Picker

![Improvely.com](https://i.imgur.com/UTRlaar.png)

This date range picker component creates a dropdown menu from which a user can
select a range of dates. I created it while building the UI for [Improvely](http://www.improvely.com), 
which needed a way to select date ranges for reports.

Features include limiting the selectable date range, localizable strings and date formats,
a single date picker mode, a time picker, and predefined date ranges.
