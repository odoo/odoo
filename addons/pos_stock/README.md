Odoo pos_stock
-----------------------------

Odoo's pos_stock
introduces a separation between the complex stock operation and
simple inventory management. Giving users the flexibility to choose the
way they need to manage their inventory.

If users only need to track quantity, Point of sales alone will be
sufficient. If users want to track products, create picking operations and
any complex stock operation, they can download the `pos_stock` module that
would override the simple inventory behaviour with the fully fledged features
implemented in stock.
