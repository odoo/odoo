  In order to test the Sale order flow, I compute the total of the listed products for Quotation1.
  "New server config + material" product price is 123.20 and ordered 1 'PCE'
  "Basic PC" product price is 450.50 and ordered 3 'PCE'
  "Medium PC" product price is 900 and ordered 5 'PCE'
  "Mainboard ASUStek A7N8X" product price is 88 and ordered 5 'PCE'
  So, Total should be [(123.20*1)+(450.50*3)+(900*5)+(88*5)] = 6414.70
-
  I check the total untaxed amount of the Quotation1 is correctly computed
-
  !assert {model: sale.order, id: order, string: The amount of the Quotation is not correctly computed}:
    - sum([l.price_subtotal for l in order_line]) == amount_untaxed
-
  I confirm the Quotation1.
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: order}
-
  I confirm the Quotation2.
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: order2}
-
  I confirm the Quotation3.
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: order3}
-
  I confirm the Quotation4.
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: order4}
-
  After confirmed Quotation, I check the Packing as well as Invoice created in related sale orders .
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    sale_order1 = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("order"))
    sale_order2 = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("order2"))

    assert sale_order2.picking_ids, "Picking not created for sale order2"
    assert sale_order3.invoice_ids, "Invoice not created for sale order3"
-
  I check that Invoice details after confirmed Quotation3.

  Now, create invoice on based of picking for order1.
-
  !python {model: stock.partial.picking}: |
    order = self.pool.get('sale.order').browse(cr, uid, ref("order"))
    pick_ids = order.picking_ids
    stock = self.pool.get('stock.picking')
    data = stock.force_assign(cr, uid, [pick_ids[0].id])
    if data == True:
      partial_id = self.create(cr, uid, {},context={'active_model': 'stock.picking','active_ids': [pick_ids[0].id]})
      self.do_partial(cr, uid, [partial_id])
    assert order.invoice_ids, "Invoice not created after picking for sale order1"
