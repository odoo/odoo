  In order to test the Sale module in OpenERP,
  I create a Sale Order for Slider Mobile for 500 quantity having Shipping Policy 'Shipping & Manual Invoice' and Invoice on 'Ordered quantities'
  in order to create an invoice based on the ordered quantity
-
  !record {model: sale.order, id: sale_order_so9}:
    date_order: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    invoice_quantity: order
    name: Test_SO006
    order_line:
      - name: Slider Mobile
        price_unit: 200
        product_uom: product.product_uom_unit
        product_uom_qty: 200.0
        state: draft
        delay: 7.0
        product_id: sale.product_product_slidermobile0
        product_uos_qty: 200.0
        type: make_to_order
    order_policy: manual
    invoice_quantity: order
    partner_id: sale.res_partner_cleartrail0
    partner_invoice_id: sale.res_partner_address_2
    partner_order_id: sale.res_partner_address_1
    partner_shipping_id: sale.res_partner_address_3
    picking_policy: direct
    pricelist_id: product.list0
    shop_id: sale.shop
-
  I confirm the Sale Order.
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: sale_order_so9}
-
  I verify that the picking has been generated for the sale order and I process it
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    so = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("sale_order_so9"))
    assert so.picking_ids,"Picking has not been generated for sale_order_so9"
    picking, = so.picking_ids
    stock_partial_picking = self.pool.get('stock.partial.picking')
    partial_id = stock_partial_picking.create(cr, uid, {},
            context={'active_model': 'stock.picking',
                     'active_ids': [picking.id]})
    stock_partial_picking.do_partial(cr, uid, [partial_id])
-
  I click on Create Invoice button to create the invoice.
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: manual_invoice, ref: sale_order_so9}
-
  I verify whether the invoice has been generated for SO
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    so = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("sale_order_so9"))
    assert so.invoice_ids, "Invoices has not been generated for sale_order_so9"
-
  I verify that an invoice is created on the basis of ordered quantity
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    sale_order_obj = self.pool.get('sale.order')
    so = sale_order_obj.browse(cr, uid, ref("sale_order_so9"))
    for so_lines in so.order_line:
      qty = so_lines.product_uom_qty
    ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('origin','=',so.name)])
    inv_brw = self.browse(cr,uid,ids)[0]
    for inv_lines in inv_brw.invoice_line:
      qty1 = inv_lines.quantity
    assert qty1==qty, "Quantities are not same"
-
  I open the Invoice for the SO.
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    sale_order_obj = self.pool.get('sale.order')
    so = sale_order_obj.browse(cr, uid, ref("sale_order_so9"))
    import netsvc
    wf_service = netsvc.LocalService("workflow")
    invoice_ids = so.invoice_ids
    for invoice in invoice_ids:
      wf_service.trg_validate(uid, 'account.invoice',invoice.id,'invoice_open', cr)
-
  Assign analytic journal into bank journal
-
  !record {model: account.journal, id: sale.account_journal_bankjournal0}:
    analytic_journal_id: account.cose_journal_sale
-
  I pay the invoice
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    sale_order_obj = self.pool.get('sale.order')
    so = sale_order_obj.browse(cr, uid, ref("sale_order_so9"))
    invoice_id = self.search(cr, uid, [('origin','=',so.name),('state','=','open')])
    self.pay_and_reconcile(cr, uid, invoice_id,
        40000.0, ref('account.cash'), ref('account.period_9'),
        ref('sale.account_journal_bankjournal0'), ref('account.cash'),
        ref('account.period_8'), ref('sale.account_journal_bankjournal0'),
        name='test')
-
  I verify the invoice are in paid state or not.
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    sale_order_obj = self.pool.get('sale.order')
    so = sale_order_obj.browse(cr, uid, ref("sale_order_so9"))
    invoice_ids = so.invoice_ids
    for invoice in invoice_ids:
        assert invoice.state =='paid', "Invoice for SO is not in done state."
-
  I check that Paid has been set to true.
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    sale_id=self.browse(cr, uid, ref("sale_order_so9"))
    assert sale_id.invoiced == True, "Paid has not been set to true"
