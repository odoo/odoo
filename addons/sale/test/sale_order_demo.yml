  Test the data with salesman,
-
  !context
    uid: 'res_users_salesman'
-
  In order to test process of the Sale Order, I create sale order
-
  !record {model: sale.order, id: sale_order_test1}:
    partner_id: base.res_partner_2
    note: Invoice after delivery
    payment_term: account.account_payment_term
    order_line: 
      - product_id: product.product_product_7
        product_uom_qty: 8
-
  I verify that the onchange was correctly triggered
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    from openerp.tools import float_compare
    order_line = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('sale.sale_order_test1')).order_line
    assert order_line[0].name == u'[A8767] Apple In-Ear Headphones', "The onchange function of product was not correctly triggered"
    assert float_compare(order_line[0].price_unit, 79.0, precision_digits=2) == 0, "The onchange function of product was not correctly triggered"
    assert order_line[0].product_uom_qty == 8, "The onchange function of product was not correctly triggered"
    assert order_line[0].product_uom.id == ref('product.product_uom_unit'), "The onchange function of product was not correctly triggered"

  I create another sale order
-
  !record {model: sale.order, id: sale_order_test2}:
    partner_id: base.res_partner_2
    order_line: 
      - product_id: product.product_product_7
        product_uom_qty: 16
        product_uom: product.product_uom_dozen

  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    from openerp.tools import float_compare
    order_line = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('sale.sale_order_test2')).order_line
    assert order_line[0].name == u'[A8767] Apple In-Ear Headphones', "The onchange function of product was not correctly triggered"
    assert float_compare(order_line[0].price_unit, 79.0 * 12, precision_digits=2) == 0, "The onchange function of product was not correctly triggered"
    assert order_line[0].product_uom.id == ref('product.product_uom_dozen'), "The onchange function of product was not correctly triggered"
