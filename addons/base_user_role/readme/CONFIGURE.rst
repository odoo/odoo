To configure this module, you need to go to *Settings / Users / Roles*,
and create a new role. From there, you can add groups to compose your role,
and then associate users to it.

You can also define default roles for a new user by editing the user called
"Default User".

Roles:

.. figure:: /OCA/server-backend/16.0/base_user_role/static/description/roles.png
   :width: 80 %
   :align: center

Add groups:

.. figure:: /OCA/server-backend/16.0/base_user_role/static/description/role_groups.png
   :width: 80 %
   :align: center

Add users (with dates or not):

.. figure:: /OCA/server-backend/16.0/base_user_role/static/description/role_users.png
   :width: 80 %
   :align: center

Instead of creating roles from scratch, it is possible to create a role
based on the groups of an existing user: select or open the user and choose
"Create role from user" in the action menu.
