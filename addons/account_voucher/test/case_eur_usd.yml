  In order to check the payment with multi-currency in OpenERP, 
  I create an invoice in EUR and make payment in USD based on the currency rating.
-
  I update the Currency USD in OpenERP for January with rate 1.200000
-
  !python {model: res.currency.rate}: |
    from datetime import datetime
    curr_id = self.pool.get('res.currency').search(cr, uid, [('name', '=', 'USD')])[0]
    date = '%s-01-01' %(datetime.now().year)
    ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('currency_id','=',curr_id), ('name', '=', date)])
    self.write(cr, uid, ids, {'rate': 1.200000})
-
  I update the Currency USD in OpenERP for February with rate 1.400000
-
  !record {model: res.currency.rate, id: feb_usd}:
    currency_id: base.USD
    name: !eval "'%s-02-01' %(datetime.now().year)"
    rate: 1.400000
-
