            <field name="body">OpenERP's electronic invoicing accelerates the creation of invoices and collection of customer payments. Invoices are created in a few clicks and your customers receive them by email. They can pay online and/or import them in their own system.

You can track customer payments easily and automate follow-ups. You get an overview of the discussion with your customers on each invoice for easier traceability.

For advanced accounting features, you should install the "Accounting and Finance" module.</field>
