Create budgets for MIS reports.

This module lets you create budgets for any MIS report. Several budgets can be
created for a given report template (ie one budget per year). Budget figures
are provided by KPI or by GL account, with different time periods. A budget can
then be selected as a data source for a MIS report column, and the report will
show the budgeted values for each KPI, adjusted for the period of the column.

Usage
=====

There are two ways to use this module: create budgets by KPI or budgets by
GL accounts. Currently, the two methods cannot be combined in the same budget.

**Budget by KPIs**

To use this this mode, you first need to flag at least some KPI in a MIS report
to be budgetable. You also need to configure the accumulation method on the KPI
according to their type.

The accumulation method determines how budgeted values spanning over a
time period are transformed to match the reporting period.

* Sum: values of shorter period are added, values of longest or partially overlapping
  periods are adjusted pro-rata temporis (eg monetary amount such as revenue).
* Average: values of included period are averaged with a pro-rata temporis weight.
  Typically used for values that do not accumulate over time (eg a number of employees).

When KPI are configured, you need to create a budget, using the MIS Budget (by
KPIs) menu, then click on the budget items button to create or import the
budgeted amounts for all your KPI and time periods.

**Budget by GL accounts**

You can also create budgets by GL accounts. In this case, the budget is
populated with one line per GL account (and optionally analytic account and/or
tags) and time period.

**Add budget columns to report instances**

Finally, a column (aka period) must be added to a MIS report instance,
selecting your newly created budget as a data source. The data will be adjusted
to the reporting period when displayed. Columns can be compared by adding a
column of type "comparison" or "sum".

Changelog
=========

16.0.5.0.0 (2023-04-01)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- Migration to 16.0.

  - removal of analytic fetures because the upstream ``analytic_distribution`` mechanism
    is not compatible; support may be introduced in separate module, depending on use
    cases (`#472 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/472>`_)


**Bugfixes**

- Fix display of budgets in presence of sub KPIs. (`#428 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/428>`_)


14.0.4.0.0 (2022-01-08)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- A label field has been added to MIS Budget by Account items. When overlap between budget
  items is allowed this allows creating a budget with several contributions for a given
  account. (`#382 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/382>`_)
- The balance field on MIS Budget by Account items is now writeable. This allows for
  easier data entry and import. (`#383 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/383>`_)
- MIS Budget by Account can now be configured to allow budget items with overlapping
  dates. Each overlapping item contributes to the budget of the corresponding period. (`#384 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/384>`_)


14.0.3.5.1 (2021-04-06)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Fix incorrect budget by account multi company security rules. (`#347 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/347>`_)


13.0.3.5.0 (2020-03-28)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- Budget by GL account: allow budgeting by GL account in addition to the
  existing mechanism to budget by KPI. Budget items have a begin and end
  date, and when reporting a pro-rata temporis adjustment is made to match
  the reporting period. (`#259 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/259>`_)


13.0.3.4.0 (2020-01-??)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Migration to odoo 13.0.

12.0.3.4.0 (2019-10-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Consider analytic tags too when detecting overlapping budget items.
  Previously only analytic account was considered, and this overlap detection
  mechanism was overlooked when analytic tags were added to budget items. (`#241 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/241>`_)


11.0.3.3.0 (2019-01-13)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- Support analytic filters. (`#15 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/15>`_)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [IMP] Support analytic tags in budget items
  (`#100 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/pull/100>`_)

11.0.3.2.0 (2018-05-02)
