- 
  Create a warehouse and set it as having a 3-step delivery flow (Pick > Pack > Ship) and a 2-step receipt route
- 
-
  Create product Combi1 that is MTO / purchase and provide a supplier for it
- 
- 
  Create product Combi2 that is MTO / purchase and provide another supplier for it and add the 2-step route to it
- 
- 
  Create 1 product Combi3 without MTO route / purchase
-
-
  Create a sales order with 100 Combi1, 50 Combi2, 60 Combi3
- 
-
  Create a sales order for another customer with 48 Combi1, 30 Combi2, 90 Combi3
- 
- 
  Create manually a purchase order for 150 Combi3
- 
- 
  Confirm both Sales Orders
- 
- 
  As the sales orders should have created purchase orders, confirm those 4 purchase orders
- 
- 
  Receive purchase orders, but for the purchase order of 100 Combi1, receive 120 instead and for 30 Combi2, receive 15 instead.  Put 120 Combi1 on two pallets C01 and C02(one 80 and one 40), put 48 Combi 1 on one pallet.  Combi2 has 5 lots for this PO.  Receive each time 10 pieces for every lot and put them in C03, C04, C05, C06 and C07.  The 15 have a sixth lot and go into C08 and C09.  The 30 of SO2 have a seventh lot, and the owner is the supplier.  They are not on any package.  
- 
- 
  Check a backorder of 15 Combi2 was created and receive 30 instead of 15.  The lot is the sixth lot and they are packaged into C10, C11 and C12 with each 5 pieces.  
- 
- 
  Check the 20 pieces combi1 extra created an extra move which was added to the Input > Quality Control picking.  Check the 2 times 15 Combi2 have a desination move from Input > Stock in the same picking as the other picking. Check those moves are in assigned state
- 
-
  Check the number of moves in the 2 pickings from Stock > Pick.  Check the sum of the quantities of the moves are still the same as on the sales order for each product.  
- 
- 
  Check the quantities also in the moves Quality Control > Stock and Input > Stock. 
- 
- 
  Check the sum of the quants of product combi1 = 168 and the sum of the quants of product combi2 = 95
- 
- 
  Do prepare partial for Combi2 from Input to Stock.  Actually you found a box with an eight lot with 5 pieces you forgot to receive and will move it separately into stock.  You also saw that in box C04 there were 5 pieces more than previously thought.  
- 
- 
  Process this picking.  Check negative quants were created for the two.  
- 
- 
  Create a purchase order for the 10 pieces. 
- 
- 
  Receive purchase order 
- 
-
  Check quants were reconciled (negative quants disappeared)
- 
- 
  Check sum of qty of quants of combi2 = 105
- 
- 
  Process picking with 2 pallets of Combi1 through quality control with do_prepare_partial, only change that the 2 pallets go into a container package.  
- 
- 
  Process the picking to bring the 2 pallets to stock and unpack them from the top pallets.  (Make sure you have 2 loose pallets again, not on the container package anymore)
- 
- 
  Process the other pickings until everything is in stock.  
- 
- 
   Check sum of qty of quants of different products
- 
- 
  Process the picking of the first sales order (with 100 PCE Combi1) from Stock > Pick.  Force availability on the picking.  The customer wants his goods asap and the warehouse manager did not have the time to encode the purchase order for Combi3. 
- 
- 
  In the meantime, assign and do_prepare_partial for the second picking (without force assigning anything)
- 
-
  For Combi1 on the first picking, we will take the pallet with 48 pieces and 52 pieces from the pallet of 80 and put this on a new pallet C50.   (which were meant for picking 1)  For Combi3, the warehouse manager will find they are in 2 packages of C31 and C32 of 30 pieces each.  Combi2 stays unchanged.  
- 
- 
  Process this picking.  
- 
- 
In the pack zone the following has to happen: As the customer is a very difficult one, he wants everything of Combi 1 packages of 10 with packages of 30 again, each package numbered => for Combi1: C101, C102, C103 in C110;  C201, C202, C203 in C120; C301, C302, C303 in C130; C401 in C140.  Put them in packages of 10 in  Pack> Output and put packages of 10 in packages of 30 from Output > Customer.  Process the 3 pickings for Sales Order 1 like this.  
- 
- 
  Check the quantities of the negative quants created. 
- 
- 
  Create manually a purchase order for the 150 pieces of Combi3.   Put each time 30 pieces in C31, C32, C33, C34, C35.  
- 
- 
  Confirm each step of the Input > Quality Control > Stock until all the pieces are in Stock without do_prepare_partial
- 
- 
  Process the second picking to the packing zone.  Make the pack operations empty and rereserve and redo do_prepare_partial.  Check the operations are as expected.  
- 
- 
  Process the other pickings without do_prepare_partial
- 
- 
  Check there are no negative quants anymore of the 3 products
- 
- 
  Check the quantities of the 3 products in the warehouse and at the customer (sum of quants or qty_available) e.g. 20 combi1 in the warehouse (check warehouse location)
- 
- 
  Check there are no packages (stock.quant.package) with quants in different locations for the 3 products
