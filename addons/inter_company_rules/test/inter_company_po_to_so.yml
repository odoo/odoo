  In order to check Inter-Company Rule of creating SO from PO, I login with user company A
-
  !context
    uid: 'res_users_company_a'
-
  Quotation of purchase order.
-
  !record {model: purchase.order, id: purchase_order_cmpa}:
    partner_id: partner_company_b
    company_id: company_a
    order_line:
    - product_id: product_consultant
      name: 'Service'
      price_unit: 450.0
-
  I confirm the order.
-
  !workflow {model: purchase.order, action: purchase_confirm, ref: purchase_order_cmpa}
-
  Login with user of company B and check sale order.
-
  !context
    uid: 'res_users_company_b'
-
  I check that the Quotation of sale order is created with proper data.

  !python {model: sale.order}: |
