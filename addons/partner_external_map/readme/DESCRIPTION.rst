This module adds buttons on the partner form to open a new tab with
the map or the route to the address of the partner.

* Each user can select the map website he wants to use in its preferences.
* There are now two buttons on the partner form view: one to open a regular map
  on the address of the partner, and another one to open an itinerary map from
  the start address configured in the preferences of the user to the address of
  the partner.

This module supports several map websites:

* `Google Maps <https://www.google.com/maps>`
* `OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>`
* `Bing Maps <https://www.bing.com/maps/>`
* `Here Maps <https://www.here.com/>`
* `MapQuest <http://www.mapquest.com/>`

If partner has the latitude and longitude information, Odoo will use that
information instead of the address.
