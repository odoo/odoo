This module adds buttons on the partner form to open a new tab with
the map or the route to the address of the partner.

* Each user can select the map website he wants to use in its preferences.
* There are now two buttons on the partner form view: one to open a regular map
  on the address of the partner, and another one to open an itinerary map from
  the start address configured in the preferences of the user to the address of
  the partner.

This module supports several map websites:

* `Google Maps <https://www.google.com/maps>`
* `OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>`
* `Bing Maps <https://www.bing.com/maps/>`
* `Here Maps <https://www.here.com/>`
* `MapQuest <http://www.mapquest.com/>`

If partner has the latitude and longitude information, Odoo will use that
information instead of the address.

Configuration
=============

If you want to create additional map websites, go to the menu
*Settings > Technical > Map Websites > Map Websites*. You are
invited to send the configuration information of your additional map websites
to one of the authors of the module, so that the module can be updated with
more pre-configured map websites.

Usage
=====

First, you need to configure in your preferences:

* The map website to use for the regular maps,
* The map website to use for the route maps,
* The start address for the route maps.

Then you can use the two new buttons on the partner form to open a regular map
or a route map.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Let decide if the user prefers to use addresses instead coordinates when
  *base_geolocalize* is installed.
