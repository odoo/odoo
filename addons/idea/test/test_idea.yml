  In order to test the Idea module in OpenERP, 
  we will create a full flow, from the idea definition up to the votes and discussions on the idea.
- |
  Given that I have an Idea category "Technical".
- 
  !record {model: idea.category, id: idea_category_technical0}:
    name: Technical
- |
  I create a New Idea of "Technical  presentation for 1 hours in every day" and specify category "Technical".
- 
  !record {model: idea.idea, id: idea_idea_0}: 
    category_id: idea_category_technical0
    created_date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    description: I want that Technical presentation are arranged for 1 hours in every
      day.\nso, on that presentation, we can know all things what improvement and development
      are done in our company.\n\n\n\n\n
    name: Technical  presentation for 1 hours in every day
    user_id: base.user_root
    
- |
  I check that the idea is in draft state.
-
  !assert {model: idea.idea, id: idea_idea_0}:
    - state == 'draft'  
    
- |
  I open this idea by clicking on the "Open" button.
- 
  !workflow {model: idea.idea, action: idea_open, ref: idea_idea_0}

  In order to check voting statistics in real systems I will create 2 new Users "test_idea_user1".
- 
  !record {model: res.users, id: test_idea_user1}: 
    company_id: base.main_company
    context_lang: en_US
    login: test_idea_user1
    name: Idea test user1
    password: test_idea_user1
    groups_id: [ base.group_tool_user, ]
- |
  And I will also create user2.    
- 
  !record {model: res.users, id: test_idea_user2}:
    company_id: base.main_company
    context_lang: en_US
    login: test_idea_user2
    name: Idea test user2
    password: test_idea_user2
    groups_id: [ base.group_tool_user, ]
- |
  In order to post vote I connect as test_idea_user1 and open the idea page
  I click on  "Submit Vote" wizard  button and vote the idea as "Normal"
    
- 
  !python {model: idea.post.vote}: |
    uid2 = ref('test_idea_user1')
    new_id = self.create(cr, uid2, {'vote': "50"}, {"active_ids": [ref("idea_idea_0")]})
    self.do_vote(cr, uid2, [new_id], {"active_ids": [ref("idea_idea_0")]})
    
- |
  To add other vote I connect as test_idea_user2 and open the idea page.
  
  I click on "Submit Vote" wizard button and vote the idea as "Very Good".
   
  and put comment "We can learn many things from technical presentation".
  
-
  !python {model: idea.post.vote}: |
    uid2 = ref('test_idea_user2')
    new_id = self.create(cr, uid2, {'vote': "100", 'note': 'We can learn many things from technical presentation'}, {"active_ids": [ref("idea_idea_0")]})
    self.do_vote(cr, uid2, [new_id], {'active_ids': [ref('idea_idea_0')]})  
        
- |
  I can see that the Average score changed in "Average score" field with value 75
-
  !record {model: idea.idea, id: idea_idea_0}: 
    vote_avg: 75 
        
- |
  I connect as Manager and  close this idea by click on "Close" button.
-
  !workflow {model: idea.idea, action: idea_close, ref: idea_idea_0}
  
- |
  I check  that the idea's state is now Accepted
-
  !assert {model: idea.idea, id: idea_idea_0}: 
    - state == 'close'
