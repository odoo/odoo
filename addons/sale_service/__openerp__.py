Automatically creates project tasks from procurement lines.
===========================================================

This module will automatically create a new task for each procurement order line
(e.g. for sale order lines), if the corresponding product meets the following
characteristics:

    * Product Type = Service
    * Procurement Method (Order fulfillment) = MTO (Make to Order)
    * Supply/Procurement Method = Manufacture

If on top of that a projet is specified on the product form (in the Procurement
tab), then the new task will be created in that specific project. Otherwise, the
new task will not belong to any project, and may be added to a project manually
later.

When the project task is completed or cancelled, the corresponding procurement
is updated accordingly. For example, if this procurement corresponds to a sale
order line, the sale order line will be considered delivered when the task is
completed.
