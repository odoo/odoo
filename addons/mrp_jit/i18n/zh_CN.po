"    This module allows Just In Time computation of procurement orders.\n"
"\n"
"    If you install this module, you will not have to run the regular "
"procurement \n"
"    scheduler anymore (but you still need to run the minimum order point "
"rule \n"
"    scheduler, or for example let it run daily.)\n"
"    All procurement orders will be processed immediately, which could in "
"some\n"
"    cases entail a small performance impact.\n"
"\n"
"    It may also increase your stock size because products are reserved as "
"soon\n"
"    as possible and the scheduler time range is not taken into account "
"anymore. \n"
"    In that case, you can not use priorities any more on the different "

"    这个模块允许补货单的即时（JIT）计算。\n"
"    安装了这个模块以后，就不需要定期运行按单生产的MRP了（但最小库存规则\n"
"    的计算仍要定期运行，比如每天运行一次）。\n"
"    所有的计划订单会立即处理，可能会对系统性能有些影响。\n"
"    \n"
"    另一个负面影响是这可能造成你库存占用的增加。因为产品立即被预留了，不再\n"
"    等待每日计划运行的时点，这样就少了个缓冲期。所以，你也不能针对移库单的\n"
"    优先级按顺序处理了。\n"
