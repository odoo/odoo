                    <p>
                        Odoo uses the concept of Warehouse as a building where you stock your goods.
                        Typically, a small business as only one warehouse (or more likely, a
                        storage room), but as your company grow, you may need to manage several
                        storage facilities.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Configure your warehouses:</h4>
                    <p>By default, Odoo has <strong>one warehouse preconfigured:</strong> you can <a t-att-href="prepare_backend_url('stock.action_warehouse_form')">edit its details here.</a></p>
                    <p>You can <strong>create additional Warehouses</strong> from the <i>Configuration/Warehouses</i> menu: each new warehouse will appear in your dashboard.</p>
                    <div class="alert alert-info">
                        <p><strong>Warehouse Locations</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            To better organize your stock, you can create
                            subdivisions of warehouses called locations (ex:
                            Shipping area, Merchandise return, Shelf 34 etc).
                            As this configuration requires more operations to
                            record, it's recommended to start without locations
                            if you did not manage inventory per zone in the
                            past.

                        <li><strong>Use the Import function</strong>, available from the <a t-att-href="prepare_backend_url('base.action_partner_supplier_form', 'list', 'purchase')">Vendors list view.</a></li>
                        <li><strong>Or better yet</strong>, send your Odoo Project Manager the file containing all your data (CSV, XLS, XLSX or ODS) and he will gladly do the importation for you.</li>

                    <t t-set="page_title" t-value="'Your Products'"/>
                    <p>Before creating your products, here are a few concepts your should understand:</p>
                    <h4>Product Types</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stockable products</strong> are subject to the full inventory management system: minimum stock rules, automatic procurement, ...</li>
                        <li><strong>Consumable products</strong> are always assumed to be in sufficient quantity in your stock, therefore their available quantities are not tracked.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Supply Chain</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Manufacture:</strong> the product is manufactured internally or the service is supplied from internal resources.</li>
                        <li><strong>Buy:</strong> the product is bought from a vendor, through a Purchase Order.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make to Stock:</strong> your customers are supplied from available stock. If the quantities in stock are too low to fulfill the order, a Purchase Order (according the minimum stock rules) will be generated in order to get the products required.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make to Order:</strong> the product is acquired only as demand requires (meaning each time a Sales Order is confirmed). This will not modify stock in the medium term because you restock with the exact amount that was ordered.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>On Hand / Available Quantities</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>On Hand products</strong> are physically located in the warehouse location at the current time. This includes items that are already allocated to fulfilling production needs or sales orders.</li>
                        <li><strong>Available products</strong> are currently available for use in filling a new order for purposes such as production or distribution. This quantity does not include items already allocated to other orders or items that are in transit from a supplier.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Units of Measure</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By default, Odoo measures products by 'units', which are a generic and can represent just about anything.</li>
                        <li>To use more precise units like pounds or kilograms, activate<i> Some products may be sold/purchased in different unit of measures (advanced)</i> in the <a t-att-href="prepare_backend_url('stock.action_stock_config_settings')">Inventory Settings.</a></li>
                        <li>Your can review and edit the pre-defined units via the <a t-attf-href="/web#view_type=list&amp;model=product.uom&amp;menu_id=#{uom_menu_id}">Units of Measures</a> configuration menu.</li>
                        <li>Of course, feel free to add your own; just remember that Odoo can convert units within the same category (for example, liters to gallons in the volume category).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Reordering Rules</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reordering rules can be used to automatically replenish your products: if the quantity on hand of a product for a given location is lower than the minimum indicated in the rule, Odoo will automatically propose a procurement to increase its quantity to the maximum level given in the rule.</li>
                        <li>The easiest way to create a reordering rule is through the <strong><span class="fa fa-refresh"/> Reordering</strong> button on a Product; then, simply enter a minimum and maximum quantity.</li>
                    </ul>

                        Making an inventory is the act of matching the
                        theoretical quantities of your products in Odoo, to the
                        real on-hand quantities in your stock.
                    </p>
                    <h4>To begin your inventory:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a new <strong>Inventory Adjustment</strong> (e.g., Starting Inventory) from the <i>Inventory Control</i> menu.</li>
                        <li><strong>Select the Location</strong> you want to inventory (one is proposed by default if you only have one warehouse).</li>
                        <li>Click on <strong>Start Inventory</strong>, then for each listed Product, enter their quantity in the <i>Real Quantity</i> column</li>
                        <li><strong>Validate the inventory</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        In Odoo, inventory management is fully integrated with the sales and
                        invoicing process. That means you can automate everything from the initial
                        quotation, to the goods delivery and final invoice.
                    </p>
                    <p>To better understand a complete sales flow, try to follow the following steps.</p>
                    <h4>From the Sales application:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Create a Quotation</strong> with a customer and some products: for each item, Odoo will check if you have enough stock on hand.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transform it to a Sales Order</strong> by clicking on <i>Confirm Sale</i>: this will automatically create a corresponding Transfer Order.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use the <span class="fa fa-truck"/> Transfers button</strong> on the Sales Order form to access it (you can of course also retrieve it from the Inventory Dashboard)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>From the Inventory application:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If your products supply chain is properly configured, the transfer should be marked as 'Ready to Transfer'. Otherwise, <strong>Check the availability</strong> manually.</li>
                        <li><strong>Validate the Delivery</strong> either by processing it one line at a time by clicking on the <span class="fa fa-gears"/> button, or as a whole with the <i>Validate</i> button</li>
                    </ul>
                </t>

                <t t-call="web_planner.page">
                    <t t-set="page_title" t-value="'Purchase Flow'"/>
                    <p>Now a similar exercise but for a purchase flow:</p>
                    <h4>From the Purchases application:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Create a Request for Quotation</strong> (or RFQ for short) to your vendor, add the products and their desired quantities, and send it by fax or email.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transform it to a Purchase Order</strong> by clicking on <i>Confirm Order</i>: this will automatically create a corresponding Transfer Order.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>From the Inventory application:</h4>

                        <li><strong>Validate the Receipt Order</strong> to mark the products as transferred to your stock location.</li>

                        A good inventory management aims to optimize stock levels: not too low (or
                        you may find yourself out of stock) and not too high (your products occupy
                        space and may loose value).
                    </p>
                    <p>Analyze your stock level at least once a month by generating a few reports:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stock Level Forecast</strong> look for rapidly increasing / decreasing stock level compared to last month</li>
                        <li><strong>Stock Valuation</strong> look for high inventory value combined with a high product quantity</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Then, <strong>adapt the Reordering Rules</strong> to reduce or increase the stock level (just be careful to only make small changes over time).</p>
                </t>

                    <t t-set="page_title" t-value="'Resolve Procurement Exceptions'"/>
                    <t t-set="page_menutitle" t-value="'Procurement Exceptions'"/>
                    <p>
                        If you configured automatic procurement, Odoo will automatically generate
                        Procurements Orders. You usually don't need to worry about them, but
                        sometimes, the system can remain blocked without generating a
                        corresponding document, usually due to a configuration problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is therefore a good idea to check and try to resolve those procurement
                        exceptions, accessible from the Schedulers menu (you need the Stock
                        Manager role to see it).
                    </p>
                    <h4>Here are some usual problems and their solutions:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No bill of materials defined for production:</strong> you need to create a BoM or indicate that the product can be purchased instead.</li>
                        <li><strong>No supplier available for a purchase:</strong> you have to define a supplier in the Procurements tab of the product form.</li>
                        <li><strong>No address defined on the supplier partner:</strong> you have to complete an address for the default supplier for the product concerned.</li>
                        <li><strong>No quantity available in stock:</strong> you have to create a reordering rule and put it in the order, or manually procure it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </t>
            </t>
            <t t-call="web_planner.category">
                <t t-set="menu_categorytitle" t-value="'Advanced'"/>
                <t t-set="menu_categoryclasses" t-value="'fa-bolt'"/>
                <t t-call="web_planner.page">
                    <t t-set="page_title" t-value="'Packages'"/>
                    <p>
                        Packages allows you to ship products by boxes, pallets, packs or whatever logistic unit you may need.
                    </p>
                    <h4>To use Packages:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Activate <i>Record packages used on packing</i></strong> in your <a t-att-href="prepare_backend_url('stock.action_stock_config_settings')">Inventory Settings</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Activate <i>Technical Features</i></strong> on your user account.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use the <i>Configuration > Packages</i></strong> menu to edit or create your Packages</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once your Packages are defined, you can attribute them to your products via the <i>Inventory</i> tab of the Product form.</p>
                </t>

                <t t-call="web_planner.page">
                    <t t-set="page_title" t-value="'Traceability'"/>
                    <p>
                        Odoo can run advanced traceability by using Product Lots and Serial
                        Numbers, usually identified by bar codes stuck on the products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lots can be encoded on incoming shipments lines, internal moves and
                        outgoing deliveries, and later can be separated into smaller lots
                        depending on the quantities ordered, but they will always keep their
                        initial lot number so you can track them.
                    </p>
                    <h4>To use Lot Tracking:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Activate <i>Track lots or serial numbers</i></strong> in your <a t-att-href="prepare_backend_url('stock.action_stock_config_settings')">Inventory Settings</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>When you process a Purchase order</strong>, assign a lot number to a group of products by clicking on the <span class="fa fa-cog"/> icon (e.g. 0001)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The lot number you created will be displayed next to the item's location. To track the lot, go into <strong><i>Traceability > Serial Numbers</i></strong>.</p>
                </t>

                <t t-call="web_planner.page">
                    <t t-set="page_title" t-value="'Routes Management'"/>
                    <p>
                        Odoo can manage <strong>advanced push / pull routes configuration</strong>, for example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Manage product manufacturing chains.</li>
                        <li>Manage default locations per product.</li>
                        <li>Define routes within your warehouse according to business needs, such as Quality Control, After Sales Services or Supplier Returns.</li>
                        <li>Help rental management, by generating automated return moves for rented products.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This is quite complex to set up, so <strong>contact your Projet Manager</strong> and he will take care of this for you.</p>
                </t>

                    <p>
                        Imagine the following situation: you ask your accountant for an inventory
                        valuation or the value added by production, he will give you a figure. If
                        you ask for the same valuation from your inventory manager, he will
                        probably give you an entirely different figure.
                    </p>
                    <p>That's because by default, Odoo is configured to do a periodic inventory valuation.</p>
                    <p>
                        The alternative is to use a real-time inventory valuation, which gives a
                        complete and permanent coherence between accounting and inventory.Indeed,
                        each stock movement will generate a corresponding accounting entry.
