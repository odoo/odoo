    def _assign_and_convert_leads(self, work_days=1):
        """ Main processing method to assign leads to sales team members. It also
        converts them into opportunities. This method should be called after
        ``_allocate_leads`` as this method assigns leads already allocated to
        the member's team. Its main purpose is therefore to distribute team
        workload on its members based on their capacity.

        Preparation

          * prepare lead domain for each member. It is done using a logical
            AND with team's domain and member's domain. Member domains further
            restricts team domain;
          * prepare a set of available leads for each member by searching for
            leads matching domain with a sufficient limit to ensure all members
            will receive leads;
          * prepare a weighted population sample. Population are members that
            should received leads. Initial weight is the number of leads to
            assign to that specific member. This is minimum value between
            * remaining this month: assignment_max - number of lead already
              assigned this month;
            * days-based assignment: assignment_max with a ratio based on
              ``work_days`` parameter (see ``CrmTeam.action_assign_leads()``)
            * e.g. Michel Poilvache (max: 30 - currently assigned: 15) limit
              for 2 work days: min(30-15, 30/15) -> 2 leads assigned
            * e.g. Michel Tartopoil (max: 30 - currently assigned: 26) limit
              for 10 work days: min(30-26, 30/3) -> 4 leads assigned

        This method then follows the following heuristic

          * take a weighted random choice in population;
          * find first available (not yet assigned) lead in its lead set;
          * if found:
            * convert it into an opportunity and assign member as salesperson;
            * lessen member's weight so that other members have an higher
              probability of being picked up next;
          * if not found: consider this member is out of assignment process,
            remove it from population so that it is not picked up anymore;

        Assignment is performed one lead at a time for fairness purpose. Indeed
        members may have overlapping domains within a given team. To ensure
        some fairness in process once a member receives a lead, a new choice is
        performed with updated weights. This is not optimal from performance
        point of view but increases probability leads are correctly distributed
        within the team.
