   I start by creating a new Opportunity. And I select partner for opportunity.
   I can see that after selecting partner his contact and email is automatically filled.
-
   !record {model: crm.lead, id: crm_opportunity_abcfuelcounits0}:
    email_from: info@balmerinc.be
    name: 'ABC FUEL CO 829264 - 10002 units'
    partner_address_id: base.res_partner_address_1
    partner_id: base.res_partner_9
    probability: 1.0
    stage_id: crm.stage_lead1
    categ_id: crm.categ_oppor2
    section_id: crm.section_sales_department

   I check that the opportunity is in 'New' state.
-
   !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm_opportunity_abcfuelcounits0}:
     - state == "draft"

- |
  I  check that phonecall record is created for that opportunity.
-
  !python {model: crm.phonecall}: |
    phone_obj = self.pool.get('crm.phonecall')
-  |
   I schedule Meeting on this current opportunity by clicking on "schedule
   Meeting".
-
   !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    self.action_makeMeeting(cr, uid, [ref("crm_opportunity_abcfuelcounits0")])

-  |
   I can see that Meeting's calendar view is shown.
   then I click on the date on which I want to schedule meeting.
   I fill proper data for that meeting and save it.
