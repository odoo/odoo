  I set a new sale team giving access rights of salesman.
-
  !context
    uid: 'crm_res_users_salesmanager'
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    team_id = self.pool.get('crm.team').create(cr, uid, {'name': "Phone Marketing"})
    self.write(cr, uid, [ref("crm_case_1")], {'team_id': team_id})
-
  Salesman check unqualified lead .
-
  !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm.crm_case_1, string: Lead is in new stage}:
    - stage_id.sequence == 1
