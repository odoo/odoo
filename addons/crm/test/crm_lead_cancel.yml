  I set a new sale team (with Marketing at parent) giving access rights of salesman.
-
  !context
    uid: 'crm_res_users_salesmanager'
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    team_id = self.pool.get('crm.team').create(cr, uid, {'name': "Phone Marketing", 'parent_id': ref("sales_team.crm_team_2")})
    self.write(cr, uid, [ref("crm_case_1")], {'team_id': team_id})
-
  Salesman check unqualified lead .
-
  !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm.crm_case_1, string: Lead is in new stage}:
    - stage_id.sequence == 1
-
  Salesman escalate the lead to parent team.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    self.case_escalate(cr, uid, [ref("crm_case_1")])
-
  Salesman check the lead is correctly escalated to the parent team.
-
  !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm.crm_case_1, string: Escalate lead to parent team}:
    - team_id.name == "Marketing"
