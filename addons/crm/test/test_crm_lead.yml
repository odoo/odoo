   In order to test the CRM in OpenERP,
   I will do a customer qualification process that
   starts with a fist contact with a customer (a lead), which will be converted to a
   business opportunity and a partner.
-
  I check installer report.
-
  !record {model: base.setup.installer , id: base_action_rule_0_1}:
    name: Test_action
-
  I create the view at the time of setup.
-
   !python {model: base.setup.installer}: |
      self.fields_view_get(cr, uid,view_id=None, view_type='form', context=None, toolbar=False, submenu=False)
-  |
   In order to test the flow, I create a two new users "user_crm" and
   I assign the group "salesman".
-
   !record {model: res.users, id: res_users_usercrm0}:
     company_id: base.main_company
     context_lang: en_US
     context_section_id: crm.section_sales_department
     groups_id:
       - base.group_sale_salesman
     login: user_crm
     name: user_crm
     password: user_crm

-  |
   I start by creating a new lead "New Customer" and I provide an address to this
   new customer, as well as an email "info@mycustomer.com".
-
   !record {model: crm.lead, id: crm_lead_newcustomer0}:
     email_from: info@mycustomer.com
     name: New Customer
     partner_name: Capegemini
     partner_id: base.res_partner_9
     phone: (855) 924-4364
     mobile: (333) 715-1450
     section_id: crm.section_sales_department
     referred: False
-  |
   I check that the lead is in 'draft' state.
-
   !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm_lead_newcustomer0, string: Lead in Draft}:
     - state == "draft"
-
   I open lead by click on "Open" button.
-
   !python {model: crm.lead}: |
     self.case_open(cr, uid, [ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")])
     fields={
            'day_open': 0.0,
            'day_close': 0.0
            }
     self._compute_day(cr, uid, [ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")], fields, context)
- |
  I check that lead is now in 'open' state.
-
  !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm_lead_newcustomer0, string: Lead in open state}:
     - state == "open"
-
   I search id for case object.
-
   !python {model: crm.case.categ}: |
     self._find_object_id(cr, uid, context)
-  |
   As the lead seems to be a real business opportunity, I will convert it to a
   partner
   and a business opportunity by clicking on the "Convert" button.
-
   !python {model: crm.lead}: |
     lead = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('crm_lead_newcustomer0'))
     action = self.convert_opportunity(cr, uid, [ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")], {'active_ids': [ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")]})
     assert action['res_model'] == 'crm.lead2opportunity.partner'
-
   |
   I select "create a new partner" option in this wizard.
-
   !record {model: crm.lead2opportunity.partner, id: crm_lead2opportunity_partner_create_0}:
      action: 'create'
      name: 'convert'
-
  Then, Click on "Create Opportunity" button of this wizard.
-
   !python {model: crm.lead2opportunity.partner}: |
      self.action_apply(cr, uid, [ref("crm_lead2opportunity_partner_create_0")], {'active_ids': [ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")], 'active_id': ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")})
-
   |
   I select "Link to an existing partner" option in this wizard.
-
   !record {model: crm.lead2opportunity.partner, id: crm_lead2opportunity_partner_create_1}:
      action: 'exist'
      name: 'existing partner'
-
  Then, Click on "Create Opportunity" button of this wizard.
-
   !python {model: crm.lead2opportunity.partner}: |
      self.action_apply(cr, uid, [ref("crm_lead2opportunity_partner_create_1")], {'active_ids': [ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")], 'active_id': ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")})
-
   |
   I select "Do not link to a partner" option in this wizard.
-
   !record {model: crm.lead2opportunity.partner, id: crm_lead2opportunity_partner_create_2}:
      action: 'nothing'
      name: 'Do not link to a partner'
-
  Then, Click on "Create Opportunity" button of this wizard.
-
   !python {model: crm.lead2opportunity.partner}: |
      self.action_apply(cr, uid, [ref("crm_lead2opportunity_partner_create_2")], {'active_ids': [ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")], 'active_id': ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")})
-  |
   In order to check the opportunity is created or not, I check type.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    lead = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0"))
    assert lead.type == 'opportunity'

-
  I create mass report of lead to opprtunity partner.
-
  !record {model: crm.lead2opportunity.partner.mass, id: crm_lead2opportunity_partner_mass0}:
    user_ids:
      - base.user_root
    section_id: crm.section_sales_department
-
  Then, execute that mass wizard.
-
   !python {model: crm.lead2opportunity.partner.mass}: |
      self.mass_convert(cr, uid, [ref("crm_lead2opportunity_partner_mass0")],{'active_ids': [ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")], 'active_id': ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")})

-
  I create notes.
-
  !record {model: crm.add.note, id: crm_add_note0}:
    {}
-
  Then, try to add notes.
-
   !python {model: crm.add.note}: |
      try:
        context.update({'active_model': "crm.lead"})
        model = ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0") or False
        self.action_add(cr, uid, [ref("crm_add_note0")],context)
      except:
        pass
-
   I close lead by click on "close" button.
-
   !python {model: crm.lead}: |
     self.case_close(cr, uid, [ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")])
- |
  I check that lead is now in 'done' state.
-
  !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm_lead_newcustomer0, string: Lead in done state}:
     - state == "done"
-
  I cancel lead by click on "cancel" button.
-
   !python {model: crm.lead}: |
     self.case_cancel(cr, uid, [ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")])
- |
  I check that lead is now in 'cancel' state.
-
  !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm_lead_newcustomer0, string: Lead in cancel state}:
     - state == "cancel"

#  yaml is also not working with smtp server and send new email.

- |
  I configure with smtp server.
- |
  And I communicate with lead through send New mail to Lead using its email address from the user who is logged in.
