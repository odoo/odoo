   In order to test the CRM in OpenERP,
   I will do a customer qualification process that
   starts with a fist contact with a customer (a lead), which will be converted to a
   business opportunity and a partner.
-  |
   In order to test the flow, I create a two new users "user_crm" and
   I assign the group "salesman".
-
   !record {model: res.users, id: res_users_usercrm0}:
     company_id: base.main_company
     context_lang: en_US
     context_section_id: crm.section_sales_department
     groups_id:
       - base.group_sale_salesman
     login: user_crm
     name: user_crm
     password: user_crm

-  |
   I start by creating a new lead "New Customer" and I provide an address to this
   new customer, as well as an email "info@mycustomer.com".
-
   !record {model: crm.lead, id: crm_lead_newcustomer0}:
     email_from: info@mycustomer.com
     name: New Customer
     partner_name: Capegemini
     phone: (855) 924-4364
     mobile: (333) 715-1450
     section_id: crm.section_sales_department
     referred: False
-  |
   I check that the lead is in 'draft' state,
-
   !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm_lead_newcustomer0, string: Lead in Draft}:
     - state == "draft"
-
   I open lead by click on "Open" button,
-
   !python {model: crm.lead}: |
     self.case_open(cr, uid, [ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")])
- |
  I check that lead is now in 'open' state.
-
  !assert {model: crm.lead, id: crm_lead_newcustomer0, string: Lead in open state}:
     - state == "open"

-  |
   As the lead seems to be a real business opportunity, I will convert it to a
   partner
   and a business opportunity by clicking on the "Convert" button.
-
   !python {model: crm.lead}: |
     lead = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('crm_lead_newcustomer0'))
     action = self.convert_opportunity(cr, uid, [ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")], {'active_ids': [ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")]})
     assert action['res_model'] == 'crm.lead2opportunity.partner'
-
   |
   Now, select "create a new partner" option in this wizard.
-
   !record {model: crm.lead2opportunity.partner, id: crm_lead2opportunity_partner_create_0}:
      action: 'create'
      name: 'convert'
-
  Then, Click on "Create Opportunity" button of this wizard.
-
   !python {model: crm.lead2opportunity.partner}: |
      self.action_apply(cr, uid, [ref("crm_lead2opportunity_partner_create_0")], {'active_ids': [ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")], 'active_id': ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0")})
-  |
   In order to check the opportunity is created or not, I check type.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    lead = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("crm_lead_newcustomer0"))
    assert lead.type == 'opportunity'

#-
#  |
#  yaml is also not working with smtp server and send new email.

- |
  I configure with smtp server.
- |
  And I communicate with lead through send New mail to Lead using its email address from the user who is logged in.
- |
  I check that communication history generated when send email to lead.
- |
  Then, I add a cc which receive copy of future communication between partner and users by mail.

- |
  I Reply to last Email to lead with some document attached.and check that communication history generated or not.
