  I start by creating a new phonecall.
-
  !record {model: crm.phonecall, id: crm_phonecall_dummycall}:
    date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d 08:00:00')
    name: Dummy call
    duration: 0.0
    section_id: crm.section_sales_department
    partner_id: base.res_partner_agrolait
    state: open
-
  I change Contact Detail of the Partner.
-
  !python {model: crm.phonecall}: |
    self.onchange_partner_address_id(cr, uid,[ref("crm_phonecall_dummycall")], ref("base.res_partner_address_8invoice"))

-
  I setting Phone call to Held (Done)
-
  !python {model: crm.phonecall}: |
    self.case_close(cr, uid, [ref("crm_phonecall_dummycall")])
-
  I check that the hone call is in 'Held' state.
-
  !assert {model: crm.phonecall, id: crm_phonecall_dummycall, string: Phone call Helded}:
    - state == "done"
