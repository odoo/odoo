-
  Customer interested in our product. so He send request by email to get more details.
-
  Mail script will be fetched him request from mail server. so I process that mail after read EML file 
-
  !python {model: mail.thread}: |
    import addons
    request_file = open(addons.get_module_resource('crm','test', 'customer_request.eml'),'rb')
    request_message = request_file.read()
    self.message_process(cr, uid, 'crm.lead', request_message)

-
  After getting the mail, I check details of new lead of that customer.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    lead_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('email_from','=', 'Mr. John Right <info@customer.com>')])
    assert lead_ids and len(lead_ids), "Lead is not created after getting request"
    lead = self.browse(cr, uid, lead_ids[0], context=context)
    assert not lead.partner_id, "Customer should be a new"
    assert lead.name == "Fournir votre devis avec le meilleur prix.", "Subject does not match"
-
  I reply him request with welcome message.
-
  !python {model: mail.compose.message}: |
    lead_ids = self.pool.get('crm.lead').search(cr, uid, [('email_from','=', 'Mr. John Right <info@customer.com>')])
    context.update({'active_model': 'crm.lead','active_id': lead_ids[0]})
    id = self.create(cr, uid, {'body_text': "Merci à l'intérêt pour notre produit.nous vous contacterons bientôt. Merci"}, context=context)
    try:
        self.send_mail(cr, uid, [id], context=context)
    except:
        pass
-
  Now, I convert him into customer and put into regular customer list.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    lead_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('email_from','=', 'Mr. John Right <info@customer.com>')])
    self.convert_partner(cr, uid, lead_ids, context=context)
-
  Now, I search customer in regular customer list.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    partner_ids = self.message_partner_by_email(cr, uid, 'Mr. John Right <info@customer.com>')
    assert partner_ids.get('partner_id'), "Customer is not found in regular customer list."
-
  I convert one phonecall request as a customer and put into regular customer list.
-
  !python {model: crm.phonecall}: |
    self.convert_partner(cr, uid, [ref('crm.crm_case_phone06')], context=context)
-
  I check coverted phonecall to partner.
-
  !python {model: res.partner}: |
    partner_id = self.search(cr, uid, [('phonecall_ids', '=', ref('crm.crm_case_phone06'))])
    assert partner_id, "Customer is not found in regular customer list."
    data = self.browse(cr, uid, partner_id, context=context)[0]
    assert data.user_id.id == ref("base.user_root"), "User not assign properly"
    assert data.name == "Bad time", "User not assign properly"
