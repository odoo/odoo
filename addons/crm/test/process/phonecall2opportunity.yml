  For customer or partner purpose, I called to him/her for discussion about openerp.
  As the success of phonecall seems to be a real business opportunity, It will convert
  it to opportunity.

  !record {model: crm.phonecall2opportunity, id: crm_phonecall2opportunity_disc_openerp}:
    name: Discuss Review Process
    partner_id: base.res_partner_tinyatwork

  !python {model: crm.phonecall2opportunity}: |
    self.action_apply(cr, uid, [ref("crm_phonecall2opportunity_disc_openerp")], {"active_id": ref("crm_case_phone04")})

  For business And I check that the phonecall and the newly created business 
  opportunity is linked to same  partner and also check with phonecall close or not.
-
  !python {model: crm.phonecall}: |
    obj_phonecall = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('crm_case_phone04'))
    ids = self.pool.get('crm.lead').search(cr, uid, [('name', '=', obj_phonecall.opportunity_id.name)])
    obj_opp = self.pool.get('crm.lead').browse(cr, uid, ids)[0]
    assert obj_phonecall.partner_id == obj_opp.partner_id, "created business opportunity is not linked to same  partner"
    assert obj_opp.stage_id.name == "New", "Converted opportunity is not in New stage"
    assert obj_opp.stage_id.probability == 10.0, "Probability of opportunity is 10.0"
    assert obj_phonecall.state == "done", "phonecall is held"
