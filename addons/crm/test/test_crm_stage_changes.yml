  In order to test the changes on stage of a lead or an opportunity with OpenERP,
  I create some leads and test the stage changes.
- 
  I want to change the probability to 0.0 when the opportunity is marked as lost.
  So I set its Change probability automatically true.
- 
  !record {model: crm.case.stage, id: crm.stage_lead6}:
    name: Lost
    on_change: true
    probability: 0.0
    section_ids:
      - crm.section_sales_department
    sequence: 0.0
- 
  I create a lead 'OpenERP Presentation'.
- 
  !record {model: crm.lead, id: crm_lead_openerppresentation0}:
    categ_id: crm.categ_oppor4
    day_close: 0.0
    day_open: 0.0
    name: OpenERP Presentation
    planned_revenue: 0.0
    probability: 0.0
    section_id: crm.section_sales_department
-
  I open the lead.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    self.case_open(cr, uid, [ref('crm_lead_openerppresentation0')])
-
  I find that this lead can be converted to opportunity. 
-
  !record {model: crm.lead2opportunity.partner, id: crm_lead2opportunity_partner0}:
    action: 'create'
    name: 'convert'
-
  So I convert the lead to opportunity.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead2opportunity.partner}: |
    self.action_apply(cr, uid, [ref('crm_lead2opportunity_partner0')], context={'active_ids': [ref('crm_lead_openerppresentation0')]})
-
  I check that lead is now converted to opportunity.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    lead = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('crm_lead_openerppresentation0'))
    assert lead.type == 'opportunity', 'Lead is not converted to opportunity!'
-
  I mark this opportunity as lost.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    self.case_mark_lost(cr, uid, [ref('crm_lead_openerppresentation0')])
-
  Now I check whether the probability is set according to stage change or not.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    opportunity = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('crm_lead_openerppresentation0'))
    assert opportunity.stage_id.id == ref('crm.stage_lead6'), 'Stage is not changed!'
    assert opportunity.probability == 0.0, 'Probability is wrong!'
-
  I create one more opportunity.
-
  !record {model: crm.lead, id: crm_lead_partnerdemo0}:
    categ_id: crm.categ_oppor3
    day_close: 0.0
    day_open: 0.0
    name: Partner Demo
    planned_revenue: 50000.0
    probability: 100.0
    section_id: crm.section_sales_department
-
  I open this opportunity.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    self.case_open(cr, uid, [ref('crm_lead_partnerdemo0')])
-
  I mark this opportunity as won.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    self.case_close(cr, uid, [ref('crm_lead_partnerdemo0')])
-
  I check whether the stage is changed to 'Won' and probability is 100.0 or not.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    opportunity = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('crm_lead_partnerdemo0'))
    assert opportunity.stage_id.id == ref('crm.stage_lead1'), 'Stage is not changed!'
    assert opportunity.probability == 100.0, 'Probability is wrong!'
