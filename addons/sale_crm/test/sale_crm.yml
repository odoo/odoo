-
  I open the wizard "Make sales".
-
  !record {model: crm.make.sale, id: crm_make_sale_0}:
    partner_id: base.res_partner_4
-
  I convert opportunity into "Quotation".
-
  !python {model: crm.make.sale}: |
    crm_lead = self.pool.get('crm.lead')
    crm = crm_lead.browse(cr, uid, ref("crm.crm_case_13"))
    self.makeOrder(cr, uid, [ref("crm_make_sale_0")], {"active_ids": [crm.id],
      "active_id": crm.id})
-
  I check that reference number of "Quotation" in opportunity.
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    crm = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("crm.crm_case_13"))
    assert crm.ref, "Quotation has not been created."
