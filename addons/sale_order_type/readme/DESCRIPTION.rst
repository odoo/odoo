This module adds a typology for the sales orders. In each different type, you
can define, invoicing and refunding journal, a warehouse, a stock route,
a sequence, the shipping policy, the invoicing policy, a payment term,
a pricelist and an incoterm.

You can see sale types as lines of business.

You are able to select a sales order type by partner so that when you add a
partner to a sales order it will get the related info to it.
