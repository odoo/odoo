Organize Events, Trainings & Webinars
-------------------------------------

### Schedule, Promote, Sell, Organize

Organize, promote and sell events online. Whether you organize meetings, conferences, trainings or webinars, Odoo gives you all the features you need to manage your events.

Create Awesome Event Pages
--------------------------

### Get rid of old WYSIWYG editors

Create beautiful event pages by drag & droping well designed *'Building Blocks'*. Publish event photos, speakers, schedule, etc.

Odoo's unique *'edit inline'* approach makes website creation surprisingly easy. "Want to introduce a speaker? to change the price of a ticket? to update a banner? promote sponsors?" just click and change.

Sell Tickets Online
-------------------

### Automate the registration and payment process

Sell registrations to your event with the multi-ticketing feature. Events can be free or for a fee. Attendees can pay online with a credit card or on invoice, based on your configuration.

Boost your sales with early-bird prices, special conditions for members, or extra services with multiple tickets.

A Clean Google Analytics Integration
------------------------------------

### Control your sales funnel with Google Analytics

Get a clear visibility of your sales funnel. Odoo's Google Analytics trackers are configured by default to track all kind of events related to shopping carts, call-to-actions, etc.

As Odoo marketing tools (mass mailing, campaigns, etc) are also linked with Google Analytics, you get a full view of your business.

Promote Events Efficiently
--------------------------

### Mass Mailing & Social Media

Use the segmentation, the social network integration and mass mailing features to promote your events to the right audience. Setup automated emails to attendees to send them last minute details.

Designer-Friendly Themes
------------------------

### Designers love working on Odoo

Themes are awesome and easy to design. You don't need to develop to create new pages, themes or building blocks. We use a clean HTML structure, a [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS and our modularity allows to distribute your themes easily.

The building block approach allows the website to stay clean after the end-users start creating new contents.
