FIXME this template has no effect as the app already contains an earlier
`website_event.snippets` view definition. It is kept in stable to be
extra-careful (who knows...) and that snippet code will totally disappear in
master (indeed, it is not really important and its structure does not seem
perfect and nobody missed this for 4+ major versions).
