Configuration
=============

There is a wizard (sign.oca.template.generate.multi) that can be used
for any model needed. If there is a template without a linked model or
linked to a model (res.partner for example) an action will be
automatically displayed in the tree and form view (only for users with
Sign permissions).

Usage
=====

Creation of templates

- Access Sign / Templates
- Create a new template
- Add a PDF File
- Access the configuration menu
- You can add a field by doing a right click inside a page
- Click on the field in order to delete or edit some configuration of it
- The template is autosaved

Sign role
---------

- Access Sign / Settings / Roles
- Create a new role (Equipment employee for example)
- You can set the Partner type you need (empty, default or expression).
- With the expression option you can set: ${object.field_name.id}
- If you create a sign request from template signer will be auto-create
  according to roles

Sign a document from template
-----------------------------

- Access Sign / Templates
- Press the Sign button from a template
- Fill all the possible partners that will sign the document
- You can link the template to a model (maintenance.equipment for
  example)
- The signature action will be opened.
- There, you can fill all the data you need.
- Once you finish, press the sign button on the top
- When the last signer signs it, the final file will be generated as a
  PDF

Sign a pending document
-----------------------

- Go to the pencil icon in the upper right corner (systray) of the sign
  request to access the pending signatures.
- Press the Sign button from signer request
- The signature action will be opened.
- There, you can fill all the data you need.
- Once you finish, press the sign button on the top
- When the last signer signs it, the final file will be generated as a
  PDF

Sign from template
------------------

- Go to any list view or form view (except sign.oca models), e.g.:
  Contacts
- Select multiple records (3 for example).
- The "Sign from template" action will be available if there are any
  sign templates created that are not linked to any model and/or any
  linked to the corresponding model.
- Select a template.
- Click on the "Generate" button.
- 3 requests will be created (each linked to each selected record) BUT
  no signer will be set.
- Some extra modules (e.g. maintenance_sign_oca) will automatically set
  the signers for each request.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Tasks
-----

- Ensure that the signature is inalterable. Maybe we might need to use
  some tools like endevise or pyHanko with a certificate. Signer can be
  authenticated using OTP.
