  I check that Initially customer invoice is in the "Draft" state
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_customer0}:
    - state == 'draft'

  I change the state of invoice to "Proforma2" by clicking PRO-FORMA button
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_proforma2, ref: account_invoice_customer0}
-
  I check that the invoice state is now "Proforma2"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_customer0}:
    - state == 'proforma2'
-
  I check that there is no move attached to the invoice
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    acc_id=self.browse(cr, uid, ref("account_invoice_customer0"))
    assert (not acc_id.move_id), "Move falsely created at pro-forma"
-
  I create invoice by clicking on Create button
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: account_invoice_customer0}
-
  I check that the invoice state is "Open"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_customer0}:
    - state == 'open'

-
  I check that now there is a move attached to the invoice
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    acc_id=self.browse(cr, uid, ref("account_invoice_customer0"))
    assert acc_id.move_id, "Move not created for open invoice"
-
  I refund the invoice Using Refund Button

  !record {model: account.invoice.refund, id: account_invoice_refund_0}:
    description: Refund To China Export
    period: account.period_5
    filter_refund: refund

    self.invoice_refund(cr, uid, [ref("account_invoice_refund_0")], {"lang": 'en_US', "tz": False, "active_model": "account.invoice", "active_ids": [ref("account.account_invoice_customer0")], "type": "out_invoice", "active_id": ref("account.account_invoice_customer0"), })
