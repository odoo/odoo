  In order to test the Lunch module in OpenERP,
  I will create one lunch order and then check the effect on cashboxes and cashmoves

- |
  Given that I have a category of lunch products "Burger".
-
  !record {model: lunch.category, id: lunch_category_burger0}:
    name: Burger
- |
  Given that I have a product "Club1" in this category with a price of "2.75".

-
  !record {model: lunch.product, id: lunch_product_club1}:
    category_id: lunch_category_burger0
    name: Club1
    price: 2.75
- |
  Given that I have a cashbox "Employee Cashbox"
-
  !record {model: lunch.cashbox, id: lunch_cashbox_cashbox0}:
    manager: base.user_root
    name: Employee Cashbox
- |
  I create a lunch order "LU001" for the "Club1" product
- |
  When I select the product "club1", the price of 2.75 is automatically proposed
-
  !record {model: lunch.order, id: lunch_order_0}:
    date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    product: 'lunch_product_club1'
    price: 2.75
    user_id: base.user_root

- |
  I check that lunch order is on draft state after having created it.
-
  !assert {model: lunch.order, id: lunch_order_0}:
    - state == 'draft'
- |
  I confirm the order "LU001" using the "Confirm Order" wizard.
-
  !record {model: lunch.order.confirm, id: lunch_order_confirm_0}:
    confirm_cashbox: 'lunch_cashbox_cashbox0'
-
  I click on "Confirm Order" button of this wizard.
-
  !python {model: lunch.order.confirm}: |
    self.confirm(cr, uid, [ref('lunch_order_confirm_0')], {'active_ids': [ref('lunch_order_0')]})

- |
  I check that the Cash Moves have been generated with the right box
  name
-
  !assert {model: lunch.order, id: lunch_order_0}:
    - cashmove.id != False

- |
  I check that the Total on the "Employee Cashbox" is -2.75

-
  !assert {model: lunch.cashbox, id: lunch_cashbox_cashbox0}:
    - sum_remain == -2.75

- |
  I create a new lunch order "LU002" for the "Club1" product, at another date.
-
  !record {model: lunch.order, id: lunch_order_1}:
    date: !eval "'%s-%s-%s' %(datetime.now().year,datetime.now().month,datetime.now().day+2)"
    product: 'lunch_product_club1'
    price: 2.75
    user_id: base.user_root

- |
  I confirm this order.open wizard and select "Employee Cashbox".
-
  !record {model: lunch.order.confirm, id: lunch_order_confirm_1}:
    confirm_cashbox: 'lunch_cashbox_cashbox0'
- |
  Now I click on "Confirm Order" button of this wizard.
-
  !python {model: lunch.order.confirm}: |
    self.confirm(cr, uid, [ref('lunch_order_confirm_1')],  {'active_ids': [ref('lunch_order_1')]})

- |
  I check that the Total on the "Employee Cashbox" is -5.50
-
  !assert {model: lunch.cashbox, id: lunch_cashbox_cashbox0}:
    - sum_remain == -5.50

- |
  I cancel the order "LU002"
-
  !record {model: lunch.order.cancel, id: lunch_order_cancel_0}:
    {}
- |
  I click on "Yes" button of this wizard for cancel order.

-
  !python {model: lunch.order.cancel}: |
    self.cancel(cr, uid, [ref('lunch_order_cancel_0')], {'active_ids': [ref('lunch_order_1')]})

- |
  I test that the Cash Moves record have been removed for the order LU002.
-
  !assert {model: lunch.order, id: lunch_order_1}:
    - cashmove.id == False

- |
  I check that the Total on the "Employee Cashbox" is -2.75
-
  !assert {model: lunch.cashbox, id: lunch_cashbox_cashbox0}:
    - sum_remain == -2.75
- |
  I reset the "Employee Cashbox" to zero using the "Set CashBox to Zero" wizard.
-
  !record {model: lunch.cashbox.clean, id: lunch_cashbox_clean_0}:
    {}
-
  Now click on "Set to Zero" button of this wizard.
-
  !python {model: lunch.cashbox.clean, id: lunch_cashbox_clean_0}: |
    self.set_to_zero(cr, uid, [ref('lunch_cashbox_clean_0')], {'active_ids': [ref('lunch_cashbox_cashbox0')]})

- |
  I check that the Total on the "Employee Cashbox" is -5.50
-
  !assert {model: lunch.cashbox, id: lunch_cashbox_cashbox0}:
    - sum_remain == 0.00
