This addon introduces a new widget.
When added to a field in a tree view, the field appears as a button which opens the record in a new tab.
When clicking on the line (but not on the button), the record is opened in the same window (as in native Odoo).

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

Edit the tree view and add the widget as the first field, usually, we should use:
.. code-block:: xml

    <field name="id" widget="open_tab"/>

You can open the record in a new tab when clicking with the mouse wheel on the external link icon.
On a usual click the record will be opened without changes (keeping the breadcrumbs).

You can also add open-tab field in tree views by selecting "Add Open Tab Field" field in
the ir.model record. When you do this, the open-tab field is added right after the name
field in the tree if the field exists, otherwise at the beginning of the tree.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Add many2one fields support.
