with traditional WYSIWYG page editors.

and propagates translations automatically across pages, following what you edit
on the master page.

Designer-Friendly Templates

Templates are awesome and easy to design. You don't need to develop to create
new pages, themes or building blocks. We use a clean HTML structure, a
[bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS.

your work easily as an Odoo module.

Fluid Grid Layouting

Building blocks are based on a responsive, mobile friendly fluid grid system
that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size
