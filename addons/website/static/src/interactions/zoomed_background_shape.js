/**
 * @todo while this solution mitigates the issue, it is not fixing it entirely
 * but mainly, we should find a better solution than a JS solution as soon as
 * one is available and ideally without having to make ugly patches to the SVGs.
 *
 * Due to a bug on Chrome when using browser zoom, there is sometimes a gap
 * between sections with shapes. This gap is due to a rounding issue when
 * positioning the SVG background images. This code reduces the rounding error
 * by ensuring that shape elements always have a width value as close to an
 * integer as possible.
 *
 * Note: a gap also appears between some shapes without zoom. This is likely
 * due to error in the shapes themselves. Many things were done to try and fix
 * this, but the remaining errors will likely be fixed with a review of the
 * shapes in future Odoo versions.
 *
 * /!\
 * If a better solution for stable comes up, this widget behavior may be
 * disabled, avoid depending on it if possible.
 * /!\
