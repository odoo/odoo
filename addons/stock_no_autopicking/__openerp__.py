This module allows an intermediate picking process to provide raw materials to production orders.
=================================================================================================

One example of usage of this module is to manage production made by your
suppliers (sub-contracting). To achieve this, set the assembled product which is
sub-contracted to 'No Auto-Picking' and put the location of the supplier in the
routing of the assembly operation.
