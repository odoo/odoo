This module aims to manage employee's expenses.
===============================================

The whole workflow is implemented:
    * Draft expense
    * Confirmation of the sheet by the employee
    * Validation by his manager
    * Validation by the accountant and invoice creation
    * Payment of the invoice to the employee

This module also uses the analytic accounting and is compatible with
the invoice on timesheet module so that you will be able to automatically
re-invoice your customer's expenses if you work by project.
