This module provides the base functions for commission operations to enable the
following:

- Define agents with their commissions
- Assign agents to partners
- Create settlements to summarize commissions for certain periods

You can define which base amount is going to be taken into account: net amount
(based on margin) or gross amount (line subtotal amount).
