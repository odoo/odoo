  In order to test scheduling of tasks, I create four tasks with different sequences and schedule them.
-
  I create first user.
-
  !record {model: res.users, id: res_users_user0}:
    company_id: base.main_company
    context_lang: en_US
    groups_id:
      - base.group_partner_manager
      - base.group_user
    login: user1
    name: User 1
    password: user1
-
  I create second user.
-
  !record {model: res.users, id: res_users_user1}:
    company_id: base.main_company
    context_lang: en_US
    groups_id:
      - base.group_partner_manager
      - base.group_user
    login: user2
    name: User 2
    password: user2
-
  I create a Project.
-
  !record {model: project.project, id: project_project_projecta0}:

        total_hours: 5.0
    total_hours: 15.0
-
  I create first task with highest sequence.
-
  !record {model: project.task, id: project_task_taska0}:
    delay_hours: 0.0
    effective_hours: 0.0
    name: Task A
    planned_hours: 5.0
    project_id: project_project_projecta0
    remaining_hours: 5.0
    sequence: 14
    state: draft
    total_hours: 5.0
-
  I create second task.
-
  !record {model: project.task, id: project_task_taskb0}:
    delay_hours: 0.0
    effective_hours: 0.0
    name: Task B
    planned_hours: 5.0
    project_id: project_project_projecta0
    remaining_hours: 5.0
    sequence: 13
    state: draft
    total_hours: 5.0
-
  I create third task.
-
  !record {model: project.task, id: project_task_taskc0}:
    delay_hours: 0.0
    effective_hours: 0.0
    name: Task C
    planned_hours: 5.0

    remaining_hours: 5.0
    sequence: 11
    state: draft
    total_hours: 5.0
-
  I create fourth task with lowest sequence.
-
  !record {model: project.task, id: project_task_taskd0}:
    delay_hours: 0.0
    effective_hours: 0.0
    name: Task D
    planned_hours: 5.0
    project_id: project_project_projecta0
    remaining_hours: 5.0
    state: draft
    total_hours: 5.0
-
  Now I create a resource for first user.
-
  !record {model: resource.resource, id: resource_resource_user0}:
    name: User 1
    resource_type: user
    time_efficiency: 1.0
    user_id: res_users_user0
-
  I create a resource for second user.
-
  !record {model: resource.resource, id: resource_resource_user1}:
    name: User 2
    resource_type: user
    time_efficiency: 1.0
    user_id: res_users_user1
-
  Now I create one phase for the project.
-
  !record {model: project.phase, id: project_phase_phasea0}:
    date_start: '2011-01-06'
    duration: 2.0
    name: Phase A
    product_uom: product.uom_day
    project_id: project_project_projecta0

      - project_id: project_project_projecta0
        resource_id: resource_resource_user0
      - project_id: project_project_projecta0

        planned_hours: 5.0
        project_id: project_project_projecta0
        remaining_hours: 5.0
        state: draft
        total_hours: 5.0
      - delay_hours: 0.0
        effective_hours: 0.0
        name: Task C
        planned_hours: 5.0
        project_id: project_project_projecta0
        remaining_hours: 5.0
        sequence: 11
        state: draft
        total_hours: 5.0
      - delay_hours: 0.0
        effective_hours: 0.0

        sequence: 13
        state: draft
        total_hours: 5.0
      - delay_hours: 0.0
        effective_hours: 0.0
        name: Task A
        planned_hours: 5.0
        project_id: project_project_projecta0
        remaining_hours: 5.0
        sequence: 14
        state: draft
        total_hours: 5.0
-
  Now I create a record to schedule the tasks of project.
-
  !record {model: project.compute.tasks, id: project_compute_tasks0}:
    project_id: project_project_projecta0
-
  I schedule the tasks.
-
  !python {model: project.compute.tasks}: |
    self.compute_date(cr, uid, [ref("project_compute_tasks0")])
-
  I check that whether the tasks now allocated to respected resources or not.
-
  !python {model: project.task}: |
    task_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('project_id','=',ref('project_project_projecta0'))])
    for task in self.browse(cr, uid, task_ids):
      if (not task.date_start) or (not task.date_end):
        raise AssertionError("Tasks are not scheduled.")
