This module allows the administrator to log user operations performed on data
models such as ``create``, ``read``, ``write`` and ``delete``.

**Table of contents**

Usage
=====

Go to `Settings / Technical / Audit / Rules` to subscribe rules. A rule defines
which operations to log for a given data model.

Then, check logs in the `Settings / Technical / Audit / Logs` menu. You can
group them by user sessions, date, data model or HTTP requests:

A scheduled action exists to delete logs older than 6 months (180 days)
automatically but is not enabled by default.
To activate it and/or change the delay, go to the
`Configuration / Technical / Automation / Scheduled Actions` menu and edit the
`Auto-vacuum audit logs` entry:

In case you're having trouble with the amount of records to delete per run,
you can pass the amount of records to delete for one model per run as the second
parameter, the default is to delete all records in one go.

There are two possible groups configured to which one may belong. The first
is the Auditlog User group. This group has read-only access to the auditlogs of
individual records through the `View Logs` action. The second group is the
Auditlog Manager group. This group additionally has the right to configure the
auditlog configuration rules.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

 * log only operations triggered by some users (currently it logs all users)
 * log read operations does not work on all data models, need investigation
