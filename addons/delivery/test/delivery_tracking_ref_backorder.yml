  In order to partial delivery with tracking number
-
  I create an outgoing picking
-
 !record {model: stock.picking, id: outgoing_shipment}:
    type: out
    carrier_tracking_ref: ABC12345
    volume: 2
    number_of_packages: 2
-
 !record {model: stock.move, id: outgoing_move}:
    picking_id: outgoing_shipment
    product_id: product.product_product_8
    product_uom: product.product_uom_unit
    product_qty: 2
    location_id: stock.stock_location_stock
    location_dest_id: stock.stock_location_customers
-
 I confirm the picking
-
  !workflow {model: stock.picking, action: button_confirm, ref: outgoing_shipment}
-
 I make a partial delivery
-
  !python {model: stock.partial.picking}: |
    pick_ids = [ref("outgoing_shipment")]
    partial_id = self.create(cr, uid, {}, context={'active_model': 'stock.picking','active_ids': pick_ids})
    partial = self.browse(cr, uid, partial_id, context=context)
    partial.move_ids[0].write({'quantity': 1})
    self.do_partial(cr, uid, [partial_id])
-
  I check backorder shipment after partial delivery.
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    shipment = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("delivery.outgoing_shipment"))
    backorder = shipment.backorder_id
    assert backorder, "Backorder should be created after partial shipment."
    assert backorder.state == 'done', "Backorder should be close after received"
    assert backorder.carrier_tracking_ref ==  'ABC12345', 'wrong tracking ref on done picking'
    assert not shipment.carrier_tracking_ref, 'remaining picking must have no tracking ref'
