// Certification Share modal on survey result page

/*
When website is installed, modal overlaps the navbar. And to fix that,
'top' css property has been utilized. As a side-effect, it shows white
stripe in some survey related pages (due to hidden navbar).

So we simply set the 'top' to 0 to for avoiding it for those pages. Thankfully,
for such pages, there's a separate asset bundle where we include this file, and
so it won't affect the rest of the website pages.
