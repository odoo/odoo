"              <p>If you fit in one of these example or if your motivation for asking the question is “I would like to participate in a discussion about ______”, then you should not be asking here but on our mailing lists.

"              <p>When a question or answer is upvoted, the user who posted them will gain some points, which are called \"karma points\". These points serve as a rough measure of the community trust to him/her. Various moderation tasks are gradually assigned to the users based on those points.</p>\n"
"              <p>For example, if you ask an interesting question or give a helpful answer, your input will be upvoted. On the other hand if the answer is misleading - it will be downvoted. Each vote in favor will generate 10 points, each vote against will subtract 10 points. There is a limit of 200 points that can be accumulated for a question or answer per day. The table given at the end explains reputation point requirements for each type of moderation task.</p>\n"
