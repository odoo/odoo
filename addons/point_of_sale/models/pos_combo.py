    ex: Create a product called `Burger Menu`

            - Drinks - will contain the list of drinks from which the customer can choose
            - Main Course - will contain the list of main courses from which the customer can choose
            - Dessert - will contain the list of desserts from which the customer can choose
        The `Burger Menu` will have a certain price, for example 20$ and the rest of the
        products will be listed with a price of 0$.
        In the event that one of the products inside one of the combos is to be more expensive,
        this product will have a specific `combo_price` which will be added to the total price
