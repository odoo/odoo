Creating registration with sale orders.
=======================================

This module allows you to automate and connect your registration creation with
your main sale flow and therefore, to enable the invoicing feature of registrations.

It defines a new kind of service products that offers you the possibility to
choose an event category associated with it. When you encode a sale order for
that product, you will be able to choose an existing event of that category and
when you confirm your sale order it will automatically create a registration for
this event.
