  I start test Fund Raising  which contain information about Donation or charity
  given by user.

  I start by creating new Funds entry for donation for books to poor school children
  with cost 500000.00 and category as "Learning And Education"
  I make payment by Cheque so I make sure that the mode on fund is selected as cheque.
