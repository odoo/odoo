  In order to test the purchase flow,I start by creating a new product 'iPod'
-
 !record {model: product.product, id: product_product_ipod0}:
    categ_id: 'product.product_category_3'
    cost_method: standard
    mes_type: fixed

  In order to test the purchase flow,I create a new record where "invoice_method" is From Picking
-
  I create purchase order for iPod.
-
  !record {model: purchase.order, id: purchase_order_po2}:
    company_id: base.main_company
    date_order: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    invoice_method: picking
    location_id: stock.stock_location_stock
    order_line:
      - date_planned: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        name: iPod
        price_unit: 100.0
        product_id: 'product_product_ipod0'
        product_qty: 10.0
        product_uom: product.product_uom_unit
        state: draft
    partner_address_id: base.res_partner_address_7
    partner_id: base.res_partner_4
    pricelist_id: purchase.list0
-
  Initially purchase order is in the draft state.
-
  !assert {model: purchase.order, id: purchase_order_po2}:
    - state == 'draft'
-
  I confirm the purchase order for iPod.
-
  !workflow {model: purchase.order, action: purchase_confirm, ref: purchase_order_po2}
-
 I check that the order which was initially in the draft state has transit to confirm state.
-
  !assert {model: purchase.order, id: purchase_order_po2}:
    - state == 'approved'
-
  I check that an entry gets created in the "Lines to Invoice" of Invoice Control on the basis of purchase order line.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    from tools.translate import _
    pur_order_obj=self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order_po2"))
    pur_line=self.pool.get( 'purchase.order.line')
    search_ids=pur_line.search(cr, uid, [('order_id', '=', pur_order_obj.name) ])
    assert search_ids, _('Purchase order line is not created!')
-
  To check that wizard "Create Invoices" gets opened.
-
  I create purchase order line invoice entry.
-
  !record {model: purchase.order.line_invoice, id: purchase_order_line_invoice_0}:
    {}
-
  I create invoice for products in the purchase order.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order.line_invoice}: |
    pur_obj=self.pool.get('purchase.order')
    ids = []
    pur_id1=pur_obj.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order_po2"))
    for line in pur_id1.order_line:
        ids.append(line.id)
    self.makeInvoices(cr, uid, [1], context={'active_ids': ids})
-
  I check that invoice gets created.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    from tools.translate import _
    pur_order_obj=self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order_po2"))
    pur_line=self.pool.get( 'purchase.order.line')
    search_ids=pur_line.search(cr, uid, [('order_id', '=', pur_order_obj.name),('invoiced', '=', '1') ])
    assert search_ids, _('Invoice is not created!')
-
  I check that a record gets created in the Pending Invoices.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    from tools.translate import _
    pur_id1=self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order_po2"))
    account_obj = self.pool.get('account.invoice')
    ids = account_obj.search(cr, uid, [('origin', '=', pur_id1.name)])
    assert ids, _('Pending Invoice is not created!')
-
 I check that the order which was initially in the confirmed state has transit to approved state.
-
  !assert {model: purchase.order, id: purchase_order_po2}:
    - state == 'approved'
-
 I check that date_approve field of Delivery&Invoices gets bind with the date on which it has been approved.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    pur_id=self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order_po2"))
    assert(pur_id.date_approve)
-
 I check that an entry gets created in the stock.picking.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    pur_id=self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order_po2"))
    assert(pur_id.picking_ids)
-
 I check that an entry gets created related to stock move.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    pur_id1=self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order_po2"))
    picking_obj = self.pool.get('stock.picking')
    ids = picking_obj.search(cr, uid, [('origin', '=', pur_id1.name)])
    pick_id = picking_obj.browse(cr, uid, ids)[0]
    move_obj = self.pool.get('stock.move')
    search_id = move_obj.search(cr, uid, [('picking_id', '=', pick_id.name)])
    assert search_id, 'No Incoming Product!'
-
  Then I create an invoice from picking by clicking on "Create Invoice" wizard
-
  !python {model: stock.invoice.onshipping}: |
    import time
    pur_obj=self.pool.get('purchase.order')
    pur_id1=pur_obj.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order_po2"))
    pick_ids = [x.id for x in pur_id1.picking_ids]
    id = self.create(cr, uid, {'invoice_date': time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), 'journal_id': ref('account.expenses_journal')},
      {'active_ids': pick_ids})
    self.create_invoice(cr, uid, [id], {"active_ids": pick_ids, "active_id": pick_ids[0]})
-
  I check that an invoice_ids field of Delivery&Invoices gets bind with the value.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    pur_id2=self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order_po2"))
    assert(pur_id2.invoice_ids)
