-
   I confirm purchase order which has invoicing control method "Based on Purchase Order Lines".
-
  !workflow {model: purchase.order, action: purchase_confirm, ref: purchase_order_6}
-
  In order to test create invoice for purchase order line.
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    invoice_line_obj = self.pool.get('purchase.order.line_invoice')
    purchase_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order_6"))
    context.update({'active_model': 'purchase.order', 'active_ids': [ref("purchase_order_6")]})
    for purchase_line in purchase_order.order_line:
        invoice_line_obj.makeInvoices(cr, uid, purchase_line.id, context=context)
-
  I check the invoice of order.
-
   !python {model: purchase.order}: |
     purchase_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order_6"))
     for purchase_line in purchase_order.order_line:
       assert len(purchase_order.invoice_ids) == 1, "Invoice should be generated."
-
 Now transfer picking list.
-
 !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    po = self.pool.get('purchase.order').browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order_6"))
    po_line_ids = [line.id for line in po.order_line]
    picking_ids = self.pool.get('stock.move').search_read(cr, uid, [('purchase_line_id','in', po_line_ids)], ['picking_id'])
    pick_id = picking_ids[0]['picking_id'][0]
    partial_id = self.do_transfer(cr, uid, [pick_id], context={'active_model': 'stock.picking','active_ids': pick_id})

    #I check the state of picking list.
    assert self.browse(cr, uid, pick_id).state == 'done', "Picking List should be in Transferred state"
-
  Purchase manager can pay an invoice therefore test with that user which have Purchase manager rights.

    for invoice in self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order_6")).invoice_ids:
        account_invoice_obj = self.pool.get('account.invoice')
        invoice.signal_workflow('invoice_open')
        invoice.pay_and_reconcile(
            invoice.amount_total, ref('account.cash'), ref('account.period_10'),
            ref('account.bank_journal'), ref('account.cash'),
            ref('account.period_10'), ref('account.bank_journal'),
            name='Payment for test customer invoice')
        assert invoice.state == 'paid', "Invoice should be in paid state"

 !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    purchase_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order_6"))
    assert purchase_order.invoiced == True,"Purchase Order should be invoiced"
    assert purchase_order.state == 'done', "Purchase order should be in done state"
