  In order to test the purchase order flow, I compute the total of the listed products.
  "Basic PC" product price is 450.20 and ordered 2 'PCE'
  "New server config + material" product price is 150.50 and ordered 5 'PCE'
  So, Total should be [(450.20*2)+(150.50*5)] = 1652.90
-
  I check the total untaxed amount of the RFQ is correctly computed
-
  !assert {model: purchase.order, id: order_purchase1, string: The amount of Test purchase is correctly computed}:
    - sum([l.price_subtotal for l in order_line]) == amount_untaxed
-
  I confirm the RFQ.
-
  !workflow {model: purchase.order, action: purchase_confirm, ref: order_purchase1}
-
  I check the "Approved" status  after confirmed RFQ.
-
  !assert {model: purchase.order, id: order_purchase1}:
    - state == 'approved'
-
  I check that the invoice details which is generated after confirmed RFQ.
