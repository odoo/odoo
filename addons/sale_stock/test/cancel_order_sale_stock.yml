  In order to test the cancel sale order.
  First I confirm order.
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: sale.sale_order_2}
-
  Now I regenerate shipment.
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: ship_recreate, ref: sale.sale_order_2}
-
  I check state of order in 'To Invoice'.
-
  !assert {model: sale.order, id: sale.sale_order_2, string: Sale order should be In Progress state}:
    - state == 'manual'
-
  I make invoice for order.
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: manual_invoice, ref: sale.sale_order_2}
-
  To cancel the sale order from Invoice Exception, I have to cancel the invoice of sale order.
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    import netsvc
    invoice_ids = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("sale.sale_order_2")).invoice_ids
    wf_service = netsvc.LocalService("workflow")
    first_invoice_id = invoice_ids[0]
    wf_service.trg_validate(uid, 'account.invoice', first_invoice_id.id, 'invoice_cancel', cr)
-
  I check order status in "Invoice Exception" and related invoice is in cancel state.
-
  !assert {model: sale.order, id: sale.sale_order_2, string: Sale order should be in Invoice Exception state}:
    - state == "invoice_except", "Order should be in Invoice Exception state after cancel Invoice"
-
  Then I click on the Ignore Exception button.
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: invoice_corrected, ref: sale.sale_order_2}

-
  I check state of order in 'In Progress'.
-
  !assert {model: sale.order, id: sale.sale_order_2, string: Sale order should be In progress state}:
    - state == 'progress'
