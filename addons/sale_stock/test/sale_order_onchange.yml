  Only sales manager Creates product so let's check with access rights of salemanager.

  !context
    uid: 'res_sale_stock_salesmanager'
-
  In order to test the onchange of the Sale Order, I create a product
-
  !record {model: product.product, id: product_onchange1}:
    name: 'Devil Worship Book'
    list_price: 66.6
-
  In sale order to test process of onchange of Sale Order with access rights of saleman.

  !context
    uid: 'res_sale_stock_salesman'

  Now i create a sale order that uses my new product
-
  !record {model: sale.order, id: sale_order_onchange1}:
    partner_id: base.res_partner_2
    order_line:
      - product_id: sale_stock.product_onchange1
        product_uom_qty: 10
-
  I verify that the onchange of product on sale order line was correctly triggered
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    from openerp.tools import float_compare
    order_line = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('sale_order_onchange1')).order_line
    assert order_line[0].name == u'Devil Worship Book', "The onchange function of product was not correctly triggered"
    assert float_compare(order_line[0].price_unit, 66.6, precision_digits=2) == 0, "The onchange function of product was not correctly triggered"
