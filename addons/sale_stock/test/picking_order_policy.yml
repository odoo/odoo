  Create a new SO to be sure we don't have one with product that can explode in mrp

  Add SO line with service type product in SO to check flow which contain service type product in SO(BUG#1167330).

  First I check the total amount of the Quotation before Approved.
-
  !assert {model: sale.order, id: sale_order_service, string: The amount of the Quotation is not correctly computed}:

  I set an explicit invoicing partner that is different from the main SO Customer

-
  I confirm the quotation with Invoice based on deliveries policy.
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: sale_order_service}

  I check that invoice should not created before dispatch delivery.

  I check the details of procurement after confirmed quotation.
