  In order to test the Prepaid Order Policy, I create a product
-
  !record {model: product.product, id: product_prepaid1}:
    name: 'OpenERP Documentation Book'
    list_price: 60.60
-
  Now i create a sale order that uses my new product
-
  !record {model: sale.order, id: sale_order_prepaid1}:
    partner_id: base.res_partner_2
    order_policy: prepaid
    order_line:
      - product_id: sale_stock.product_prepaid1
        product_uom_qty: 10
-
  Now I confirm the Quotation with "Pay before delivery" policy with access rights of salesman.
-
  !context
    uid: 'res_sale_stock_salesman'
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: sale_order_prepaid1}
-
  I check that delivery order should not created before invoice is paid.
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    sale_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("sale_order_prepaid1"))
    assert len(sale_order.picking_ids) == False, "Delivery order should not created before invoice."
    assert sale_order.invoice_ids, "Invoice should be created."
