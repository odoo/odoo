    'description': """
        This module sends the taxes information (mostly VAT) of the
        vendor bills and customer invoices to the SII.  It is called
        Procedimiento G417 - IVA. Llevanza de libros registro.  It is
        required for every company with a turnover of +6Mâ‚¬ and others can
        already make use of it.  The invoices are automatically
        sent after validation.

        How the information is sent to the SII depends on the
        configuration that is put in the taxes.  The taxes
        that were in the chart template (l10n_es) are automatically
        configured to have the right type.  It is possible however
        that extra taxes need to be created for certain exempt/no sujeta reasons.

        You need to configure your certificate and the tax agency.
