                    When prices are calculated through a formula or fixed, the original price is
                    generally not displayed in the sale order lines or checkout. However, for
                    specific formula-based pricing rules, the discount can be shown on the shop
                    page (e.g. product pages and configurators), but not in the cart or at checkout.
                    In these cases, the calculated/fixed price is set as the unit price with 0% discount
                    in the order.
