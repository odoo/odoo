<!--
Non-website snippets need to be generated in the same way as other snippets, following the format 
module_name.configurator_{snippet_name} or module_name.configurator_{page}_{snippet_name}. 
Since these snippets are module-specific (e.g. website_sale) and do not exist in the website module
itself, their parent_id cannot be resolved during generation until the respective module
is installed.

To handle this, configurator snippet addons are declared inside their own module manifest.
This makes the generation process independent, generic, and consistent with how themes also declare
their configurator snippets. As a result, snippet templates are only generated when the
corresponding module is installed, ensuring that dynamic snippets are correctly created and linked
at the right time.
