        Multi-company/Multi-website compliant:
        We can't add a condition on domain_force without losing `product`
        ir.rule domain_force. It is better to disabled them to be able to
        reenable them on `website_sale` uninstall.
        Don't override domain_force or we will need to hardcode the original
        domain in `uninstall_hook` rather than just reenabling records.
