# Adyen

## Technical details

SDK: [Web Drop-in](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/build-your-integration/?platform=Web&integration=Drop-in)
version `4.7.3`

APIs:

- [Checkout API](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/) version 67
- [Recurring API](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Recurring/) version 49

This module relies on the Web Drop-in SDK to render the list of available payment methods and their
payment detail inputs on the payment form. The JS and CSS assets of the SDK are loaded directly from
the `__manifest__.py` file.

When the Web Drop-in needs to fetch/push information from/to Adyen or when a payment operation
(e.g., refund, offline payment) is executed from the backend, a server-to-server API call is made to
the appropriate API endpoint.

This combined solution allows the implementation of a good-quality direct payment flow whilst
keeping the front-end development efforts low. The 3DS support is also entirely delegated to Adyen.

This is achieved by following Web Drop-in's
"[Advanced flow](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/build-your-integration/additional-use-cases/advanced-flow-integration)".
It is preferred over the recommended "Sessions flow" that only requires dealing with the `/sessions`
endpoint instead of three `/payment/*` endpoints because two of those are still required to
implement tokenization and handle 3DS redirects.
