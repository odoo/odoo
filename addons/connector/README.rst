This is a framework designed to build connectors with external systems,
usually called ``Backends`` in the documentation.

Documentation: http://odoo-connector.com

It features:

* A jobs queue

    In which the connectors can push functions (synchronization tasks)
    to be executed later.

* An event pattern

    The connectors can subscribe listener functions on the events,
    executed when the events are fired.

* Connector base classes

    Called ``ConnectorUnit``.

    Include base classes for the use in connectors, ready to be extended:

    * ``Synchronizer``: flow of an import or export
    * ``Mapper``: transform a record according to mapping rules
    * ``Binder``: link external IDs with local IDS
    * ``BackendAdapter``: adapter interface for the exchanges with the backend
    * But ``ConnectorUnit`` can be extended to accomplish any task

* A multi-backend support

    Each ``ConnectorUnit`` can be registered amongst a backend type (eg.
    Magento) and a backend version (allow to have a different ``Mapper``
    for each backend's version for instance)

It is used for example used to connect Magento_ and Prestashop_, but
also used with Solr, CMIS, ...
