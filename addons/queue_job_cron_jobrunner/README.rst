This module implements a simple ``queue.job`` runner using ``ir.cron`` triggers.

It's meant to be used on environments where the regular job runner can't be run, like
on Odoo.sh.

Unlike the regular job runner, where jobs are dispatched to the HttpWorkers, jobs are
processed on the CronWorker threads by the job runner crons. This is a design decision
because:

* Odoo.sh puts HttpWorkers to sleep when there's no network activity
* HttpWorkers are meant for traffic. Users shouldn't pay the price of background tasks.

For now, it only implements the most basic features of the ``queue_job`` runner, notably
no channel capacity nor priorities. Please check the ROADMAP for further details.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

.. warning::

    Don't use this module if you're already running the regular ``queue_job`` runner.


For the easiest case, no configuration is required besides installing the module.

To avoid CronWorker CPU timeout from abruptly stopping the job processing cron, it's
recommended to launch Odoo with ``--limit-time-real-cron=0``, to disable the CronWorker
timeout altogether.

.. note::

    In Odoo.sh, this is done by default.


Parallel execution of jobs can be achieved by leveraging multiple ``ir.cron`` records:

* Make sure you have enough CronWorkers available (Odoo CLI ``--max-cron-threads``)
* Duplicate the ``queue_job_cron`` cron record as many times as needed, until you have
  as much records as cron workers.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Support channel capacity and priority. (See ``_acquire_one_job``)
* Gracefully handle CronWorker CPU timeouts. (See ``_job_runner``)
* Commit transaction after job state updated to started. (See ``_process``)
