This module extends the functionality of `sale_commission` to allow you to
auto-populate salesmen as commission agents without setting explicitly them
on the customer.

**IMPORTANT**: The salesman will be only populated if no other commission agent
is set via other method, to assure that there's no overlapping commissions.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

#. Go to *Contacts*.
#. Search for the contact linked to the salesman user and open it.
#. If it's actually linked to a user, you'll see a new check in the
   *Agent information* page, called "Convert salesman into agent".
#. Check it for having that salesman automatically populated as agent. You
   need to assign a commission to that agent as well.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Sales > Orders > Quotations* and create a new one.
#. Fill the customer with one with no agents set.
#. Select a salesman with the mark checked.
#. Add a line in the quotation, and you will see the salesman populated as
   commission agent.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- This module can be split into 2: account_commission_salesman and sale_commission_salesman.
