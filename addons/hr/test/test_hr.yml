  In order to test hr module in OpenERP, I will create new Employee, Department and Job Position.
-
  I create "R&D Department" in Department form.
-
  !record {model: hr.department, id: hr_department_rd0}:
    manager_id: base.user_root
    name: 'R & D'
-
  Now, I create a new employee “Mark Johnson”, and select department as “R&D Department”.
-
  !record {model: hr.employee, id: hr_employee_mark}:
    address_home_id: base.res_partner_address_1
    company_id: base.main_company
    gender: male
    marital: 'single'
    name: Mark Johnson
-
  I change the company of the employee.
-
  !python {model: hr.employee}: |
    self.onchange_company(cr, uid, [ref('hr_employee_mark')], ref('base.main_company'), None)
-
  I assign department for employee “Mark Johnson”.
-
  !python {model: hr.employee}: |
    res = self.onchange_department_id(cr, uid, [ref('hr_employee_mark')], ref('hr_department_rd0'), None)
    assert res['value']['parent_id']
-
  Now I create a user for employee “Mark Johnson”.
-
  !record {model: res.users, id: hr_users_markjohnson0}:
    context_lang: en_US
    groups_id:
      - base.group_user
    login: markjohnson
    name: Mark Johnson
    password: markjohnson
-
  I assign user to employee “Mark Johnson”.
-
  !python {model: hr.employee}: |
    res = self.onchange_user(cr, uid, [ref('hr_employee_mark')], ref('hr_users_markjohnson0'), None)
-
  In order to check the wizard “Employee Hierarchy” , I will create new employee “Phil Graves” and select “Mark Johnson” as
  Manager.
-
  !record {model: hr.employee, id: hr_employee_phil}:
    address_home_id: base.res_partner_address_3000
    company_id: base.main_company
    gender: male
    name: Phil Graves
    user_id: base.user_demo
    parent_id: 'hr_employee_mark'
-
  I fill the Working address for Employee.
-
  !python {model: hr.employee}: |
    res = self.onchange_address_id(cr, uid, ref('hr_employee_phil'), ref('base.res_partner_address_3000'), None)
    assert res['value']
-
  I will open up form view of  “Mark Johnson” and test the wizard “Employee Hierarchy” so it display the employee
  hierarchy starting from “Mark Johnson”.

-
  I will create new Job Position. I will check successful creation of new Job Position by adding the information.
-
  !record {model: hr.job, id: hr_job_jea0}:
    department_id: 'hr_department_rd0'
    description: 'Position of Junior Application Engineer'
    expected_employees: 5
    name: 'JAE'
-
  I check that Employee form is in "Open" state.
-
  !assert {model: hr.job, id: hr_job_jea0}:
    - state == 'open'
-
  I create Employee for job position.
-
  !record {model: hr.job, id: hr_job_jea0}:
    employee_ids:
      - address_home_id: base.res_partner_address_1
        name: Manuel Lehba
        department_id: 'hr_department_rd0'
        gender: male
        parent_id: 'hr_employee_mark'
-
  I check that "Number of Employees" field have some value.
-
  !assert {model: hr.job, id: hr_job_jea0}:
    - no_of_employee != False
-
  As more requirements on the said job position are come, I increase the number of expected employees.
-
  !python {model: hr.job}: |
    res = self.on_change_expected_employee(cr, uid, [ref('hr_job_jea0')], 6, 3, None)
    assert res['value']['expected_employees']
-
  I open the job position for recruitment.
-
  !python {model: hr.job}: |
    self.job_recruitement(cr, uid, [ref('hr_job_jea0')])
-
  I assign the job position to employee and mark the position.
-
  !python {model: hr.job}: |
    self.job_open(cr, uid, [ref('hr_job_jea0')])
-
  Now the process is over so I don't want to use this position. I mark it as Old.
-
  !python {model: hr.job}: |
    self.job_old(cr, uid, [ref('hr_job_jea0')])
-
  I create a parent category for the new recruited employees who are Freshers.
-
  !record {model: hr.employee.category, id: hr_employee_category_fresher0}:
    name: Fresher
-
  I create another category for Junior Level freshers.
-
  !record {model: hr.employee.category, id: hr_employee_category_juniorlevel0}:
    name: Junior Level
    parent_id: hr_employee_category_fresher0
-
  I open the tree view of Categories and see the categories in a hierarchical manner.
-
  !python {model: hr.employee.category}: |
    res = self.name_get(cr, uid, [ref('hr_employee_category_juniorlevel0')], None)
    assert res
