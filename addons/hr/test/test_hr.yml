  In order to test  hr module in OpenERP, I will create new Employee , Department and Job Position.
-
  I create "R&D Department"  in Department form.
-
  !record {model: hr.department, id: hr_department_rd0}:
    manager_id: base.user_root
    name: 'R & D'
-
  Now, I  create a new employee “Mark Johnson”, and select department as "R&D Department".
-
  !record {model: hr.employee, id: hr_employee_mark}:
    address_home_id: base.res_partner_address_1
    company_id: base.main_company
    gender: male
    marital: 'single'
    name: Mark Johnson
    user_id: base.user_root
    department_id: 'hr_department_rd0'
-
  In order to check the wizard “Employee Hierarchy” , I will create new employee “Phil Graves ” and select "Mark Johnson" as
  Manager.
-
  !record {model: hr.employee, id: hr_employee_phil}:
    address_home_id: base.res_partner_address_3000
    company_id: base.main_company
    gender: male
    name: Phil Graves
    user_id: base.user_demo
    parent_id: 'hr_employee_mark'
-
  I will open up form view of  “Mark Johnson” and test the wizard “Employee Hierarchy” so it display the employee
  hierarchy starting from “Mark Johnson”.

-
  I will create new Job Position. I will check successfull creation of new Job Position by adding the information.
-
  !record {model: hr.job, id: hr_job_jea0}:
    department_id: 'hr_department_rd0'
    description: 'Position of Junior Application Engineer'
    expected_employees: 5
    name: 'JAE'
-
  I check that Employee form is in "Open" state.
-
  !assert {model: hr.job, id: hr_job_jea0}:
    - state == 'open'

-
  I create Employee for job position.
-
  !record {model: hr.job, id: hr_job_jea0}:
    employee_ids:
      - address_home_id: base.res_partner_address_1
        name: Manuel Lehba
        department_id: 'hr_department_rd0'
        gender: male
        parent_id: 'hr_employee_mark'
-
  I check that "Number of Employees" field have some value.
-
  !assert {model: hr.job, id: hr_job_jea0}:
    - no_of_employee != False
