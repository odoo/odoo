    filter_domain_lead only keep the leaves of a domain that verify a given check. Logical operators that involves
    a leaf that is undetermined (because it does not pass the check) are ignored.

    each operator is a logic gate:
    - '&' and '|' take two entries and can be ignored if one of them (or the two of them) is undetermined
    -'!' takes one entry and can be ignored if this entry is undetermined

    params:
        - domain: the domain that needs to be filtered
        - field_check: the function that the field name used in the leaf needs to verify to keep the leaf
        - field_name_mapping: dictionary of the form {'field_name': 'new_field_name', ...}. Occurences of 'field_name'
          in the first element of domain leaves will be replaced by 'new_field_name'. This is usefull when adapting a
          domain from one model to another when some field names do not match the names of the corresponding fields in
          the new model.
