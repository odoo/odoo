"""Provides a class Stdin which can be used to emulate the regular old
sys.stdin for the PythonWin interactive window. Right now it just pops
up a input() dialog. With luck, someone will integrate it into the
actual PythonWin interactive window someday.

WARNING: Importing this file automatically replaces sys.stdin with an
instance of Stdin (below). This is useful because you can just open
Stdin.py in PythonWin and hit the import button to get it set up right
if you don't feel like changing PythonWin's source. To put things back
the way they were, simply use this magic incantation:

    sys.stdin = sys.stdin.real_file
