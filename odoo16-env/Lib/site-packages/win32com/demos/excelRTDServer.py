class ExcelRTDServer:
    """Base RTDServer class.

    Provides most of the features needed to implement the IRtdServer interface.
    Manages topic adding, removal, and packing up the values for excel.

    Shouldn't be instanciated directly.

    Instead, descendant classes should override the CreateTopic() method.
    Topic objects only need to provide a GetValue() function to play nice here.
    The values given need to be atomic (eg. string, int, float... etc).

    Also note: nothing has been done within this class to ensure that we get
    time to check our topics for updates. I've left that up to the subclass
    since the ways, and needs, of refreshing your topics will vary greatly. For
    example, the sample implementation uses a timer thread to wake itself up.
    Whichever way you choose to do it, your class needs to be able to wake up
    occaisionally, since excel will never call your class without being asked to
    first.

    Excel will communicate with our object in this order:
      1. Excel instanciates our object and calls ServerStart, providing us with
         an IRTDUpdateEvent callback object.
      2. Excel calls ConnectData when it wants to subscribe to a new "topic".
      3. When we have new data to provide, we call the UpdateNotify method of the
         callback object we were given.
      4. Excel calls our RefreshData method, and receives a 2d SafeArray (row-major)
         containing the Topic ids in the 1st dim, and the topic values in the
         2nd dim.
      5. When not needed anymore, Excel will call our DisconnectData to
         unsubscribe from a topic.
      6. When there are no more topics left, Excel will call our ServerTerminate
         method to kill us.

    Throughout, at undetermined periods, Excel will call our Heartbeat
    method to see if we're still alive. It must return a non-zero value, or
    we'll be killed.

    NOTE: By default, excel will at most call RefreshData once every 2 seconds.
          This is a setting that needs to be changed excel-side. To change this,
          you can set the throttle interval like this in the excel VBA object model:
            Application.RTD.ThrottleInterval = 1000 ' milliseconds
