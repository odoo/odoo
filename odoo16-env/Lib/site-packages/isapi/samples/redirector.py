# This is a sample ISAPI extension written in Python.
#
# Please see README.txt in this directory, and specifically the
# information about the "loader" DLL - installing this sample will create
# "_redirector.dll" in the current directory.  The readme explains this.

# Executing this script (or any server config script) will install the extension
# into your web server. As the server executes, the PyISAPI framework will load
# this module and create your Extension and Filter objects.

# This is the simplest possible redirector (or proxy) we can write.  The
# extension installs with a mask of '*' in the root of the site.
# As an added bonus though, we optionally show how, on IIS6 and later, we
# can use HSE_ERQ_EXEC_URL to ignore certain requests - in IIS5 and earlier
# we can only do this with an ISAPI filter - see redirector_with_filter for
# an example.  If this sample is run on IIS5 or earlier it simply ignores
# any excludes.
