adodbapi

A Python DB-API 2.0 (PEP-249) module that makes it easy to use Microsoft ADO
for connecting with databases and other data sources using CPython.

Home page: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/adodbapi>

Features:
* 100% DB-API 2.0 (PEP-249) compliant (including most extensions and recommendations).
* Includes pyunit testcases that describe how to use the module.
* Fully implemented in Python. -- runs in current versions of Python 3
* Licensed under the LGPL license, which means that it can be used freely even in commercial programs subject to certain restrictions.
* The user can choose between paramstyles: 'qmark' 'named' 'format' 'pyformat' 'dynamic'
* Supports data retrieval by column name e.g.:
  for row in myCurser.execute("select name,age from students"):
     print("Student", row.name, "is", row.age, "years old.")
* Supports user-definable system-to-Python data conversion functions (selected by ADO data type, or by column)

Prerequisites:
* C Python 3.6 or higher
 and pywin32 (Mark Hammond's python for windows extensions.)

Installation:
* (C-Python on Windows): Install pywin32 ("pip install pywin32") which includes adodbapi.
* (IronPython on Windows): Download adodbapi from http://sf.net/projects/adodbapi.  Unpack the zip.

NOTE: ...........
If you do not like the new default operation of returning Numeric columns as decimal.Decimal,
you can select other options by the user defined conversion feature.
Try:
        adodbapi.apibase.variantConversions[adodbapi.ado_consts.adNumeric] = adodbapi.apibase.cvtString
or:
        adodbapi.apibase.variantConversions[adodbapi.ado_consts.adNumeric] = adodbapi.apibase.cvtFloat
or:
        adodbapi.apibase.variantConversions[adodbapi.ado_consts.adNumeric] = write_your_own_convertion_function

notes for 2.6.2:
    The definitive source has been moved to https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/tree/master/adodbapi.
    Remote has proven too hard to configure and test with Pyro4. I am moving it to unsupported status
    until I can change to a different connection method.
what's new in version 2.6
   A cursor.prepare() method and support for prepared SQL statements.
   Lots of refactoring, especially of the Remote and Server modules (still to be treated as Beta code).
   The quick start document 'quick_reference.odt' will export as a nice-looking pdf.
   Added paramstyles 'pyformat' and 'dynamic'. If your 'paramstyle' is 'named' you _must_ pass a dictionary of
      parameters to your .execute() method. If your 'paramstyle' is 'format' 'pyformat' or 'dynamic', you _may_
      pass a dictionary of parameters -- provided your SQL operation string is formatted correctly.

what's new in version 2.5
   Remote module: (works on Linux!) allows a Windows computer to serve ADO databases via PyRO
   Server module: PyRO server for ADO.  Run using a command like= C:>python -m adodbapi.server
   (server has simple connection string macros: is64bit, getuser, sql_provider, auto_security)
   Brief documentation included.  See adodbapi/examples folder adodbapi.rtf
   New connection method conn.get_table_names() --> list of names of tables in database

   Vastly refactored. Data conversion things have been moved to the new adodbapi.apibase module.
   Many former module-level attributes are now class attributes. (Should be more thread-safe)
   Connection objects are now context managers for transactions and will commit or rollback.
   Cursor objects are context managers and will automatically close themselves.
   Autocommit can be switched on and off.
   Keyword and positional arguments on the connect() method work as documented in PEP 249.
   Keyword arguments from the connect call can be formatted into the connection string.
   New keyword arguments defined, such as: autocommit, paramstyle, remote_proxy, remote_port.
  *** Breaking change: variantConversion lookups are simplified: the following will raise KeyError:
         oldconverter=adodbapi.variantConversions[adodbapi.adoStringTypes]
      Refactor as: oldconverter=adodbapi.variantConversions[adodbapi.adoStringTypes[0]]
