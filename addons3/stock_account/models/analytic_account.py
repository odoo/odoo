        Ensures that the total amount distributed across all lines always adds up to exactly `amount` per
        plan. We try to correct for compounding rounding errors by assigning the exact outstanding amount when
        we detect that a line will close out a plan's total percentage. However, since multiple plans can be
        assigned to a line, with different prior distributions, there is the possible edge case that one line
        closes out two (or more) tallies with different compounding errors. This means there is no one correct
        amount that we can assign to a line that will correctly close out both all plans. This is described in
        more detail in the commit message, under "concurrent closing line edge case".
