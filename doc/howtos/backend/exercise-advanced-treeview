+                     colorValue1:condition1;colorValue2:condition2;...
+                     Each color can be specified by using HTML color codes:
+                      - the hexadecimal form:
+                        #ff8080 => ff for red, 80 for green and blue
+                      - the color keywords:
+                        red, black, white, grey, ...
+
+                     When writing your condition, don’t forget that you are
+                     in an XML file. You have to escape your special characters
+                     in order to make the whole file XML-compliant
+
+                     For example:
+                      - lesser than symbol is written &lt;
+                      - greater than symbol is written &gt; -->

+                        view. If you don’t want to make it visible, just hide
+                        it with the invisible attribute
