.. todo:: what's the documentation's license?

The documentation is currently organized in four sections:

* :doc:`tutorials`, aimed at introducing the primary areas of developing Odoo
  modules
* :doc:`guides`, didactic documents covering more specific and specialized
  areas of Odoo, trying to solve more specific problems
* :doc:`reference`, which ought be the complete and canonical documentation
  for Odoo subsystems
* :doc:`modules`, documenting useful specialized modules and integration
  methods (and currently empty)
