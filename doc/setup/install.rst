Installing Odoo
===============

There are multiple ways to install Odoo, or not install it at all, depending
on the intended use case.

This documents attempts to describe most of the installation options.

:ref:`setup/install/online`
    The easiest way to use Odoo in production or to try it.

:ref:`setup/install/packaged`
    Suitable for testing Odoo, developing modules and can be used for
    long-term production use with additional deployment and maintenance work.

:ref:`setup/install/source`
    Provides greater flexibility:  e.g. allow multiple running Odoo versions on
    the same system. Good for developing modules, can be used as base for
    production deployment.

:ref:`setup/install/docker`
    If you usually use docker_ for development or deployment, an official
    docker_ base image is available.


.. _setup/install/editions:

Editions
========

There are two different Editions_ of Odoo: the Community and Enterprise versions.
Using the Enterprise version is possible on our SaaS_ and accessing the code is
restricted to Enterprise customers and partners. The Community version is freely
available to anyone.

If you already use the Community version and wish to upgrade to Enterprise, please
refer to :ref:`setup/enterprise` (except for :ref:`setup/install/source`).


.. _setup/install/online:

Online
======

Demo
----

To simply get a quick idea of Odoo, demo_ instances are available. They are
shared instances which only live for a few hours, and can be used to browse
around and try things out with no commitment.

Demo_ instances require no local installation, just a web browser.

SaaS
----

Trivial to start with, fully managed and migrated by Odoo S.A., Odoo's SaaS_
provides private instances and starts out free. It can be used to discover and
test Odoo and do non-code customizations (i.e. incompatible with custom modules
or the Odoo Apps Store) without having to install it locally.

Can be used for both testing Odoo and long-term production use.

Like demo_ instances, SaaS_ instances require no local installation, a web
browser is sufficient.


.. _setup/install/packaged:

Packaged installers
===================

Odoo provides packaged installers for Windows, deb-based distributions
(Debian, Ubuntu, …) and RPM-based distributions (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, …) for
both the Community and Enterprise versions.

These packages automatically set up all dependencies (for the Community version),
but may be difficult to keep up-to-date.

Official Community packages with all relevant dependency requirements are
available on our nightly_ server. Both Communtiy and Enterprise packages can
be downloaded from our download_ page (you must to be logged in as a paying
customer or partner to download the Enterprise packages).

Windows
-------

* Download the installer from our nightly_ server (Community only)
  or the Windows installer from the download_ page (any edition)
* Run the downloaded file

  .. warning:: on Windows 8, you may see a warning titled "Windows protected
               your PC". Click :guilabel:`More Info` then
               :guilabel:`Run anyway`

* Accept the UAC_ prompt
* Go through the various installation steps

Odoo will automatically be started at the end of the installation.

Linux
-----

Debian/Ubuntu
'''''''''''''

Odoo 12.0 'deb' package currently supports `Debian Stretch`_, `Ubuntu 18.04`_ or above.

Prepare
^^^^^^^

Odoo needs a `PostgreSQL`_ server to run properly. The default configuration for
the Odoo 'deb' package is to use the PostgreSQL server on the same host as your
Odoo instance. Execute the following command as root in order to install
PostgreSQL server :

.. code-block:: console

  # apt-get install postgresql -y

In order to print PDF reports, you must install wkhtmltopdf_ yourself:
the version of wkhtmltopdf_ available in Debian repositories does
not support headers and footers so it is not used as a direct dependency.
The recommended version is 0.12.5 and is available on
`the wkhtmltopdf download page`_, in the archive section. Previously
recommended version 0.12.1 is a good alternative.
More details on the various versions and their respective quirks can be
found in our `wiki <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Wkhtmltopdf>`_.

Repository
^^^^^^^^^^

Odoo S.A. provides a repository that can be used with  Debian and Ubuntu
distributions. It can be used to install Odoo Community Edition by executing the
following commands as root:

.. code-block:: console

    # wget -O - https://nightly.odoo.com/odoo.key | apt-key add -
    # echo "deb http://nightly.odoo.com/12.0/nightly/deb/ ./" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/odoo.list
    # apt-get update && apt-get install odoo

You can then use the usual ``apt-get upgrade`` command to keep your installation up-to-date.

At this moment, there is no repository for the Enterprise Edition.

Deb Package
^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of using the repository as described above, the 'deb' package can be
downloaded here:

* Community Edition: `nightly`_
* Enterprise Edition `Download`_

You can then use ``gdebi``:

.. code-block:: console

    # gdebi <path_to_installation_package>

Or ``dpkg``:

.. code-block:: console

    # dpkg -i <path_to_installation_package> # this probably fails with missing dependencies
    # apt-get install -f # should install the missing dependencies
    # dpkg -i <path_to_installation_package>

This will install Odoo as a service, create the necessary PostgreSQL_ user
and automatically start the server.

.. warning:: The 3 following python packages are only suggested by the Debian package.
             Those packages are not available in Ubuntu Xenial (16.04).

* python3-vobject: Used in calendars to produce ical files.
* python3-pyldap: Used to authenticat users with LDAP.
* python3-qrcode: Used by the hardware driver for ESC/POS

If you need one or all of the packages mentioned in the above warning, you can install them manually.
One way to do it, is simply using pip3 like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo pip3 install vobject qrcode
    $ sudo apt install libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev
    $ sudo pip3 install pyldap

.. warning:: Debian 9 and Ubuntu do not provide a package for the python module
             num2words.
             Textual amounts will not be rendered by Odoo and this could cause
             problems with the "l10n_mx_edi" module.

If you need this feature, you can install the python module like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo pip3 install num2words

Fedora
''''''

Odoo 12.0 'rpm' package supports Fedora 26.
As of 2017, CentOS does not have the minimum Python requirements (3.5) for
Odoo 12.0.

Prepare
^^^^^^^
Odoo needs a `PostgreSQL`_ server to run properly. Assuming that the 'sudo'
command is available and configured properly, run the following commands :

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo dnf install -y postgresql-server
    $ sudo postgresql-setup --initdb --unit postgresql
    $ sudo systemctl enable postgresql
    $ sudo systemctl start postgresql

In order to print PDF reports, you must install wkhtmltopdf_ yourself:
the version of wkhtmltopdf_ available in Debian repositories does
not support headers and footers so it is not used as a direct dependency.
The recommended version is 0.12.5 and is available on
`the wkhtmltopdf download page`_, in the archive section. Previously
recommended version 0.12.1 is a good alternative.
More details on the various versions and their respective quirks can be
found in our `wiki <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Wkhtmltopdf>`_.

Repository
^^^^^^^^^^

Odoo S.A. provides a repository that can be used with the Fedora distibutions.
It can be used to install Odoo Community Edition by executing the following
commands:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://nightly.odoo.com/12.0/nightly/rpm/odoo.repo
    $ sudo dnf install -y odoo
    $ sudo systemctl enable odoo
    $ sudo systemctl start odoo

RPM package
^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of using the repository as described above, the 'rpm' package can be
downloaded here:

* Community Edition: `nightly`_
* Enterprise Edition `Download`_

Once downloaded, the package can be installed using the 'dnf' package manager:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo dnf localinstall odoo_12.0.latest.noarch.rpm
    $ sudo systemctl enable odoo
    $ sudo systemctl start odoo


.. _setup/install/source:

Source Install
==============

The source "installation" is really about not installing Odoo, and running it directly from source
instead.

This can be more convenient for module developers as the Odoo source is more easily accessible
than using packaged installation (for information or to build this documentation and have it
available offline).

It also makes starting and stopping Odoo more flexible and explicit than the services set up by the
packaged installations, and allows overriding settings using
:ref:`command-line parameters <reference/cmdline>` without needing to edit a configuration file.

Finally it provides greater control over the system's set up, and allows to more easily keep
(and run) multiple versions of Odoo side-by-side.

Windows
-------

Fetch the sources
'''''''''''''''''

There are two ways to obtain the source code of Odoo: as a zip **archive** or through **git**.

Archive
^^^^^^^

Community Edition:

* `Official download page <download_>`_
* `GitHub repository <community-repository_>`_
* `Nightly server <nightly_>`_

Enterprise Edition:

* `Official download page <download_>`_
* `GitHub repository <enterprise-repository_>`_

Git
^^^

The following requires git_ to be installed on your machine and that you have basic knowledge of
git commands.

Community Edition:

.. code-block:: doscon

    C:\> git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git


Enterprise Edition: (see :ref:`setup/install/editions` to get access)

.. code-block:: doscon

  C:\> git clone https://github.com/odoo/enterprise.git

.. note:: **The Enterprise git repository does not contain the full Odoo source code**. It is only
          a collection of extra add-ons. The main server code is in the Community version. Running
          the Enterprise version actually means running the server from the Community version with
          the addons-path option set to the folder with the Enterprise version. You need to clone
          both the Community and Enterprise repository to have a working Odoo Enterprise
          installation.

Prepare
'''''''

Python
^^^^^^

Odoo requires Python 3.5 or later to run. Use the the official `Python 3 installer
<https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_ to download and install Python 3 on your machine.

During installation, check **Add Python 3 to PATH**, then click **Customize Installation** and make
sure that **pip** is checked.

.. note:: If Python 3 is already installed, make sure that it is 3.5 or above, as previous versions
          are not compatible with Odoo.

          .. code-block:: doscon

              C:\> python3 --version

          Verify also that pip_ is installed for this version.

          .. code-block:: doscon

              C:\> pip3 --version

PostgreSQL
^^^^^^^^^^

Odoo uses PostgreSQL as database management system. Download and install the `latest version of
PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/>`_.

By default, the only user is `postgres` but Odoo forbids connecting as `postgres`, so you need to
create a new PostgreSQL user:

#. Add PostgreSQL's `bin` directory (by default: `C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\<version>\\bin`) to
   your `PATH`.
#. Create a postgres user with a password using the pg admin gui:

   * Open **pgAdminIII**.
   * Double-click the server to create a connection.
   * Select :menuselection:`Edit --> New Object --> New Login Role`.
   * Enter the username in the **Role Name** field (e.g. `odoo`).
   * Open the **Definition** tab and enter the password (e.g. ``odoo``), then click **OK**.

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Odoo dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file located at the root of the Odoo
community directory. Most of them can be installed with **pip**.

.. tip:: It can be preferable to not mix python modules packages between different instances of Odoo
         or with your system. You can use virtualenv_ to create isolated Python environments.

Navigate to the path of your Odoo Community installation (`YourOdooCommunityPath`) and run **pip**
on the requirements file:

.. code-block:: doscon

    C:\> cd \YourOdooCommunityPath
    C:\YourOdooCommunityPath> C:\Python35\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt

.. warning:: Some dependencies cannot be installed through pip and require to be installed manually.
             In particular:

             * `psycopg` must be installed with
               `this installer <http://www.stickpeople.com/projects/python/win-psycopg/>`_.
             * `wkhtmltopdf` must be installed in version `0.12.5 <the wkhtmltopdf download page_>`_
               for it to support headers and footers. See our
               `wiki <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Wkhtmltopdf>`_ for more details on the
               various versions.

For languages with right-to-left interface (such as Arabic or Hebrew), the package `rtlcss` is
needed:

#. Download and install `nodejs <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_.
#. Install `rtlcss`:

   .. code-block:: doscon

       C:\> npm install -g rtlcss

#. Edit the System Environment's variable `PATH` to add the folder where `rtlcss.cmd` is located
   (typically: `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\`).

Running Odoo
''''''''''''

Once all dependencies are set up, Odoo can be launched by running `odoo-bin`, the
command-line interface of the server. It is located at the root of the Odoo Community directory.

To configure the server, you can either specify :ref:`command-line arguments <reference/cmdline/server>` or a
:ref:`configuration file <reference/cmdline/config>`.

.. tip:: For the Enterprise edition, you must add the path to the `enterprise` addons to the
         `addons-path` argument. Note that it must come before the other paths in `addons-path` for
         addons to be loaded correctly.

Common necessary configurations are:

* PostgreSQL user and password.
* Custom addon paths beyond the defaults, to load your own modules.

A typical way to run the server would be:

.. code-block:: doscon

    C:\YourOdooCommunityPath> python3 odoo-bin -r dbuser -w dbpassword --addons-path=addons,../mymodules --db-filter=mydb$

Where `YourOdooCommunityPath` is the path of the Odoo Community installation, `dbuser` is the
PostgreSQL login, `dbpassword` is the PostgreSQL password, `../mymodules` is a directory with
additional addons and `mydb` is the default database to serve on `localhost:8069`.

^^^^^^^^^^^^

Odoo dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file located at the root of the Odoo
community directory. Most of them can be installed with **pip**.

.. tip:: It can be preferable to not mix python modules packages between different instances of Odoo

on the requirements file:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd /YourOdooCommunityPath
    /YourOdooCommunityPath$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

.. warning:: For libraries using native code (Pillow, lxml, greenlet, gevent, psycopg2, ldap), it
             may be necessary to install development tools and native dependencies before pip is
             able to install the dependencies themselves. These are available in `-dev` or `-devel`
             packages for Python, PostgreSQL, libxml2, libxslt, libevent, libsasl2 and libldap2.

.. warning:: Some dependencies cannot be installed through pip and require to be installed manually.
             In particular:

             * `wkhtmltopdf` must be installed in version `0.12.5 <the wkhtmltopdf download page_>`_
               for it to support headers and footers. See our
               `wiki <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Wkhtmltopdf>`_ for more details on the
               various versions.

Common necessary configurations are:

* PostgreSQL user and password. Odoo has no defaults beyond
  `psycopg2's defaults <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/module.html>`_: connects over a UNIX socket on
  port `5432` with the current user and no password.
* Custom addon paths beyond the defaults, to load your own modules.

A typical way to run the server would be:

.. code-block:: console

    /YourOdooCommunityPath$ python3 odoo-bin --addons-path=addons,../mymodules --db-filter=mydb$

Where `YourOdooCommunityPath` is the path of the Odoo Community installation, `../mymodules` is a
