# lxml_html_clean

## Motivation

This project was initially a part of [lxml](https://github.com/lxml/lxml). Because HTML cleaner is designed as blocklist-based, many reports about possible security vulnerabilities were filed for lxml and that make the project problematic for security-sensitive environments. Therefore we decided to extract the problematic part to a separate project.

**Important**: the HTML Cleaner in ``lxml_html_clean`` is **not** considered appropriate **for security sensitive environments**. See e.g. [bleach](https://pypi.org/project/bleach/) for an alternative.

This project uses functions from Python's `urllib.parse` for URL parsing which **do not validate inputs**. For more information on potential security risks, refer to the [URL parsing security](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#url-parsing-security) documentation. A maliciously crafted URL could potentially bypass the allowed hosts check in `Cleaner`.

## Installation

You can install this project directly via `pip install lxml_html_clean` or as an extra of lxml
via `pip install lxml[html_clean]`. Both ways install this project together with lxml itself.

## Security

For discussions regarding security-related issues or any sensitive reports, please contact us privately.
You can reach out to lbalhar(at)redhat.com or frenzy.madness(at)gmail.com to ensure your concerns
are addressed confidentially and securely.
