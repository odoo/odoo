Dark Garden
===========



GENERAL

Dark Garden is a decorative outline font of unusual shape. The typeface
is based on author's original hand drawings. The letterform is complex,
with all characters decorated with spikes resembling thorns or flames,
character spacing is very dense. Such a theme makes it a great font for
titles, banners, logos etc.

As of version 1.1, Dark Garden includes letters of the English alphabet,
Polish and German diacritic characters and some punctuation. Unicode
encoding is used. The font is equipped with hinting information to allow
high quality rendering at small point sizes. Only horizontal and
vertical hints are currently used, future versions might take advantage
of truetype hinting instructions some day. There are also a lot of
kerning pairs defined in the font - they were chosen after looking at a
choice of Polish and English texts and selecting the character pairs
that needed manual kerning.

The font was created with PfaEdit / FontForge
(http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/) - an opensource font editing tool.
Pfaedit uses its own text-based file format which can then be exported
to truetype, postscript, opentype and many other font formats. This
makes it possible to generate font files for Dark Garden in any of the
many supported formats, so it can be used on almost any platform. So
far, the truetype version has been tested on X11 (Linux) and Windows,
the opentype version worked on Windows but not X11. Truetype should also
work on Mac OS.
