.. ADMONITION:: Where are the moved events? They "disappeared"

        This implementation does not take partition boundaries
        into consideration. It will only work when the directory
        tree is entirely on the same file system. More specifically,
        any part of the code that depends on inode numbers can
        break if partition boundaries are crossed. In these cases,
        the snapshot diff will represent file/directory movement as
        created and deleted events.
