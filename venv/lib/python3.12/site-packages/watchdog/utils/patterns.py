# Non-pure path objects are only allowed on their respective OS's.
# Thus, these utilities require "pure" path objects that don't access the filesystem.
# Since pathlib doesn't have a `case_sensitive` parameter, we have to approximate it
# by converting input paths to `PureWindowsPath` and `PurePosixPath` where:
#   - `PureWindowsPath` is always case-insensitive.
#   - `PurePosixPath` is always case-sensitive.
# Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath.match
