"""NIF, sometimes N.I.F. (NumÃ©ro d'Identification Fiscale, Algeria tax number).

The NIF was adopted by the Algerian tax authorities on 2006, replacing the NIS
number.

The NIF applies to physical persons, legal persons, legal entities,
administrative entities, local branches for foreign companies, associations,
professional organisations, etc.

The NIF consists of 15 digits, but sometimes it can be 20 digits long in order
to represent branches or secondary establishments.
