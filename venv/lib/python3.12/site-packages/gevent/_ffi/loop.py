## Note on CFFI objects, callbacks and the lifecycle of watcher objects
#
# Each subclass of `watcher` allocates a C structure of the
# appropriate type e.g., struct gevent_ev_io and holds this pointer in
# its `_gwatcher` attribute. When that watcher instance is garbage
# collected, then the C structure is also freed. The C structure is
# passed to libev from the watcher's start() method and then to the
# appropriate C callback function, e.g., _gevent_ev_io_callback, which
# passes it back to python's _python_callback where we need the
# watcher instance. Therefore, as long as that callback is active (the
# watcher is started), the watcher instance must not be allowed to get
# GC'd---any access at the C level or even the FFI level to the freed
# memory could crash the process.
#
# However, the typical idiom calls for writing something like this:
#  loop.io(fd, python_cb).start()
# thus forgetting the newly created watcher subclass and allowing it to be immediately
# GC'd. To combat this, when the watcher is started, it places itself into the loop's
# `_keepaliveset`, and it only removes itself when the watcher's `stop()` method is called.
# Often, this is the *only* reference keeping the watcher object, and hence its C structure,
# alive.
#
# This is slightly complicated by the fact that the python-level
# callback, called from the C callback, could choose to manually stop
# the watcher. When we return to the C level callback, we now have an
# invalid pointer, and attempting to pass it back to Python (e.g., to
# handle an error) could crash. Hence, _python_callback,
# _gevent_io_callback, and _python_handle_error cooperate to make sure
# that the watcher instance stays in the loops `_keepaliveset` while
# the C code could be running---and if it gets removed, to not call back
# to Python again.
