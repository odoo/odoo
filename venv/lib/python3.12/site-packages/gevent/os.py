"""
Low-level operating system functions from :mod:`os`.

Cooperative I/O
===============

This module provides cooperative versions of :func:`os.read` and
:func:`os.write`. These functions are *not* monkey-patched; you
must explicitly call them or monkey patch them yourself.

POSIX functions
---------------

On POSIX, non-blocking IO is available.

- :func:`nb_read`
- :func:`nb_write`
- :func:`make_nonblocking`

All Platforms
-------------

On non-POSIX platforms (e.g., Windows), non-blocking IO is not
available. On those platforms (and on POSIX), cooperative IO can
be done with the threadpool.

- :func:`tp_read`
- :func:`tp_write`

Child Processes
===============

The functions :func:`fork` and (on POSIX) :func:`forkpty` and :func:`waitpid` can be used
to manage child processes.

.. warning::

   Forking a process that uses greenlets does not eliminate all non-running
   greenlets. Any that were scheduled in the hub of the forking thread in the parent
   remain scheduled in the child; compare this to how normal threads operate. (This behaviour
   may change is a subsequent major release.)
