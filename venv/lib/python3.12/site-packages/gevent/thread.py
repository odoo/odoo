"""
Implementation of the standard :mod:`thread` module that spawns greenlets.

.. note::

    This module is a helper for :mod:`gevent.monkey` and is not
    intended to be used directly. For spawning greenlets in your
    applications, prefer higher level constructs like
    :class:`gevent.Greenlet` class or :func:`gevent.spawn`.
