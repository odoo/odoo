Certificates and keys
---------------------

* ``ca.pem``: internal root CA certificate
* ``server.pem``: TLS server certificate for slapd, signed by root CA. The
  server cert is valid for DNS Name ``localhost`` and IPs ``127.0.0.1`` and
  ``:1``.
* ``server.key``: private key for ``server.pem``, no password protection
* ``client.pem``: certificate for TLS client cert authentication, signed by
  root CA.
* ``client.key``: private key for ``client.pem``, no password protection

Configuration and scripts
-------------------------

* ``ca.conf`` contains the CA definition as well as extensions for the
  client and server certificates.
* ``client.conf`` and ``server.conf`` hold the subject and base configuration
  for server and client certs.
* ``gencerts.sh`` creates new CA, client and server certificates.
* ``gennssdb.sh`` can be used to create a NSSDB for all certs and keys.
