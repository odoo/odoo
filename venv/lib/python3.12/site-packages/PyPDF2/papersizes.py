    # 1. Get the size of the paper in mm
    # 2. Convert it to inches (25.4 millimeters are equal to 1 inches)
    # 3. Convert it to pixels ad 72dpi (1 inch is equal to 72 pixels)

    # All Din-A paper sizes follow this pattern:
    # 2xA(n-1) = A(n)
    # So the height of the next bigger one is the width of the smaller one
    # The ratio is always approximately the ratio 1:2**0.5
    # Additionally, A0 is defined to have an area of 1 m**2
    # Be aware of rounding issues!
