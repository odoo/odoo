Overview
--------

polib is a library to manipulate, create, modify gettext files (pot, po and mo
files). You can load existing files, iterate through it's entries, add, modify
entries, comments or metadata, etc... or create new po files from scratch.

polib supports out of the box any version of python ranging from 2.7 to latest
3.X version.

polib is pretty stable now and is used by many 
`opensource projects <http://polib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/projects.html>`_.

The project code and bugtracker is hosted on 
`Github <https://github.com/izimobil/polib/>`_.

polib is generously documented, you can `browse the documentation online 
<http://polib.readthedocs.org/>`_, a good start is to read 
`the quickstart guide  <http://polib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html>`_.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just use ``pip``:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install polib


Basic example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    import polib

    pofile = polib.pofile('/path/to/pofile.po')

    for entry in pofile:
        print(entry.msgid, entry.msgtxt)
