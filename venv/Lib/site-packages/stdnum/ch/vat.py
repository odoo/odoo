"""VAT, MWST, TVA, IVA, TPV (Mehrwertsteuernummer, the Swiss VAT number).

The Swiss VAT number is based on the UID but is followed by either "MWST"
(Mehrwertsteuer, the German abbreviation for VAT), "TVA" (Taxe sur la valeur
ajoutÃ©e in French), "IVA" (Imposta sul valore aggiunto in Italian) or "TPV"
(Taglia sin la plivalur in Romanian).

This module only supports the "new" format that was introduced in 2011 which
completely replaced the "old" 6-digit format in 2014.
