"""CPR (personnummer, the Danish citizen number).

The CPR is the national number to identify Danish citizens and is stored in
the Det Centrale Personregister (Civil Registration System). The number
consists of 10 digits in the format DDMMYY-SSSS where the first part
represents the birth date and the second a sequence number. The first digit
of the sequence number indicates the century.

The numbers used to validate using a checksum but since the sequence numbers
ran out this was abandoned in 2007. It is also not possible to use the
checksum only for numbers that have a birth date before that because the
numbers are also assigned to immigrants.
