I make all the fonts (around 370 of them) on my web page and they're all free.
I offer Deluxe versions of some of my fonts for sale.  They contain several
 weights and styles of each font.  Just click on the Deluxe button at Larabie Fonts to see them.

I've provided the world with about 300 free fonts,
so if you'd like to make a donation I'd be more than happy to accept it.

No donation is too small!  Music and artwork are good too.
If you have some CD's you're not listening to anymore, send 'em along!

Send anything at all to

If you decide to send a cheque (that's how we spell it in Canada)
make it payable to Ray Larabie.  If you want to double check the address
have a look at the donation section on any of my webpages.

Canadian or US funds?  Any funds are fine with me.
Whatever's easy for you.
