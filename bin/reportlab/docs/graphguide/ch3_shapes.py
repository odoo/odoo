This chapter describes the concept of shapes and their importance

Some properties of existing shapes and their relationship to
diagrams are presented and the notion of having different renderers
for different output formats is briefly introduced.

heading2("Available Shapes")

Drawings are made up of Shapes.
Absolutely anything can be built up by combining the same set of
primitive shapes.
The module $shapes.py$ supplies a number of primitive shapes and

Let's run through the style properties. $fillColor$ is obvious.
$stroke$ is publishing terminology for the edge of a shape;
the stroke has a color, width, possibly a dash pattern, and
some (rarely used) features for what happens when a line turns
a corner.
$rx$ and $ry$ are optional geometric properties and are used to
define the corner radius for a rounded rectangle.

Strings use a common font standard: the Type 1 Postscript fonts

Finally, we have Group objects.
A group has a list of contents, which are other nodes.

a coordinate system - and put them in one group called "Axis".
