        # (i) is implemented via `LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, each
        # worker just acquire one available job at a time and lock it so
        # the other workers don't select it too.
        # (ii) is implemented via the `WHERE` statement, when a job has
        # been processed, its nextcall is updated to a date in the
        # future and the optional triggers are removed.
        #
        # Note about (ii): it is possible that a job becomes available
        # again quickly (e.g. high frequency or self-triggering cron).
        # This function doesn't prevent from acquiring that job multiple
        # times at different moments. This can block a worker on
        # executing a same job in loop. To prevent this problem, the
        # callee is responsible of providing a `job_ids` tuple without
        # the jobs it has executed already.
        #
        # An `UPDATE` lock type is the strongest row lock, it conflicts
        # with ALL other lock types. Among them the `KEY SHARE` row lock
        # which is implicitely aquired by foreign keys to prevent the
        # referenced record from being removed while in use. Because we
        # never delete acquired cron jobs, foreign keys are safe to
        # concurrently reference cron jobs. Hence, the `NO KEY UPDATE`
