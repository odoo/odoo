"\n"
"        The stock_calendar module handles minimum stock rules (=orderpoints / reordering rules) differently by\n"
"        the possibility to take into account the purchase and delivery calendars.\n"
"\n"
"        Normally, the scheduler will go through all orderpoints and will create a procurement with a quantity taking\n"
"        into account the current stock and all future stock moves.  For companies working with fresh products, this is\n"
"        a problem, because if you order the products needed over 2 weeks now and they arrive tomorrow, then\n"
"        these products won't be fresh anymore in two weeks.\n"
"\n"
"        To solve this, we added a delivery calendar to the orderpoint.  The future stock moves (they represent the needs)\n"
"        taken into account will be limited to those until the second delivery according to the calendar.\n"
"        So if I am delivered every week on Tuesday and on Friday, when I order on Monday, I will be delivered on Tuesday\n"
"        with all what is needed until Friday.\n"
"\n"
"        This however is not good enough as you want to create a purchase order only before the date of the delivery as the\n"
"        future needs might change.  (otherwise you could have ordered too much already)  For this, we added a\n"
"        purchase calendar and the orderpoint will only be triggered when the scheduler is run within the time specified\n"
"        by the purchase calendar.  (a last execution date will also check if it has not already been triggered within this time)\n"
"\n"
"        However, sometimes we have double orders: suppose we need to order twice on Friday: a purchase order for Monday\n"
"        and a purchase order for Tuesday.  Then we need to have two orders at the same time.\n"
"        To handle this, we put a procurement group on the calendar line and for the purchase calendar line we need to do,\n"
"        we will check the corresponding delivery line.  On the procurement group, we can tell to propagate itself to the purchase\n"
"        and this way it is possible to have an order for Monday and one for Tuesday.\n"
"\n"
"        With normal orderpoints, the dates put on the purchase order are based on the delays in the system for the product/company.\n"
"        This does not correspond to what is done with the calendars, so the purchase/delivery dates will be set according to the calendars also.\n"
"\n"
"        The calendars we use are on weekly basis.  It is possible however to have a start date and end date for e.g. the Tuesday delivery.\n"
"        It is also possible to put exceptions for days when there is none.\n"

msgid ""
"Adds support for authentication by LDAP server.\n"
"===============================================\n"
"This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, and\n"
"will automatically create Odoo users for them on the fly.\n"
"\n"
"**Note:** This module only work on servers who have Python's ``ldap`` module installed.\n"
"\n"
"Configuration:\n"
"--------------\n"
"After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters in the\n"
"Configuration tab of the Company details. Different companies may have different\n"
"LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be unique\n"
"in Odoo, even across multiple companies).\n"
"\n"
"Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), by\n"
"simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.\n"
"This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the master\n"
"LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to\n"
"authenticate it.\n"
"\n"
"Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers supporting\n"
"it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.\n"
"\n"
"For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf\n"
"manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.\n"
"\n"
"Security Considerations:\n"
"------------------------\n"
"Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the Odoo database, the LDAP server\n"
"is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the\n"
"password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.\n"
"\n"
"Odoo does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of password\n"
"should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP users).\n"
"\n"
"It is also possible to have local Odoo users in the database along with\n"
"LDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious example).\n"
"\n"
"Here is how it works:\n"
"---------------------\n"
"    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local Odoo\n"
"      database;\n"
"    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no local\n"
"      password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;\n"
"\n"
"As LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local Odoo database\n"
"(which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server is\n"
"queried to do the authentication.\n"
"\n"
"Enabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP server is\n"
"encrypted.\n"
"\n"
"User Template:\n"
"--------------\n"
"In the LDAP configuration on the Company form, it is possible to select a *User\n"
"Template*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local users\n"
"whenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP authentication. This\n"
"allows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.\n"
"\n"
"**Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password will be\n"
"         assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively setting\n"
"         a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). You\n"
"         usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user is to\n"
"         login once with a valid LDAP user, let Odoo create a blank local\n"
"         user with the same login (and a blank password), then rename this new\n"
"         user to a username that does not exist in LDAP, and setup its groups\n"
