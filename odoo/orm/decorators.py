        decorated method are included in the ``create`` or ``write`` call.
        It implies that fields not present in a view will not trigger a call
        during a record creation. A override of ``create`` is necessary to make
        sure a constraint will always be triggered (e.g. to test the absence of

def ondelete(*, at_uninstall: bool) -> Decorator:
    """
    Mark a method to be executed during :meth:`~odoo.models.BaseModel.unlink`.

    The goal of this decorator is to allow client-side errors when unlinking
    records if, from a business point of view, it does not make sense to delete
    such records. For instance, a user should not be able to delete a validated
    sales order.

    While this could be implemented by simply overriding the method ``unlink``
    on the model, it has the drawback of not being compatible with module
    uninstallation. When uninstalling the module, the override could raise user
    errors, but we shouldn't care because the module is being uninstalled, and
    thus **all** records related to the module should be removed anyway.

    This means that by overriding ``unlink``, there is a big chance that some
    tables/records may remain as leftover data from the uninstalled module. This
    leaves the database in an inconsistent state. Moreover, there is a risk of
    conflicts if the module is ever reinstalled on that database.

    Methods decorated with ``@ondelete`` should raise an error following some
    conditions, and by convention, the method should be named either
    ``_unlink_if_<condition>`` or ``_unlink_except_<not_condition>``.

    .. code-block:: python

        @api.ondelete(at_uninstall=False)
        def _unlink_if_user_inactive(self):
            if any(user.active for user in self):
                raise UserError("Can't delete an active user!")

        # same as above but with _unlink_except_* as method name
        @api.ondelete(at_uninstall=False)
        def _unlink_except_active_user(self):
            if any(user.active for user in self):
                raise UserError("Can't delete an active user!")

    :param bool at_uninstall: Whether the decorated method should be called if
        the module that implements said method is being uninstalled. Should
        almost always be ``False``, so that module uninstallation does not
        trigger those errors.

    .. danger::
        The parameter ``at_uninstall`` should only be set to ``True`` if the
        check you are implementing also applies when uninstalling the module.

        For instance, it doesn't matter if when uninstalling ``sale``, validated
        sales orders are being deleted because all data pertaining to ``sale``
        should be deleted anyway, in that case ``at_uninstall`` should be set to
        ``False``.

        However, it makes sense to prevent the removal of the default language
        if no other languages are installed, since deleting the default language
        will break a lot of basic behavior. In this case, ``at_uninstall``
        should be set to ``True``.

def onchange(*args: str) -> Decorator:
    """Return a decorator to decorate an onchange method for given fields.

    In the form views where the field appears, the method will be called
    when one of the given fields is modified. The method is invoked on a
    pseudo-record that contains the values present in the form. Field
    assignments on that record are automatically sent back to the client.

    Each argument must be a field name::

        (fields of relational fields e.g. ``partner_id.tz``) are not

    .. danger::

        (:meth:`create`, :meth:`read`, :meth:`write`, :meth:`unlink`)
        on the aforementioned recordset is undefined behaviour,
        as they potentially do not exist in the database yet.

        Instead, simply set the record's field like shown in the example
        above or call the :meth:`update` method.

    .. warning::

        It is not possible for a ``one2many`` or ``many2many`` field to modify
        itself via onchange. This is a webclient limitation - see `#2693 <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/2693>`_.
