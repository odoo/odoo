class Command(enum.IntEnum):
    """
    :class:`~odoo.fields.One2many` and :class:`~odoo.fields.Many2many` fields
    expect a special command to manipulate the relation they implement.

    Internally, each command is a 3-elements tuple where the first element is a
    mandatory integer that identifies the command, the second element is either
    the related record id to apply the command on (commands update, delete,
    unlink and link) either 0 (commands create, clear and set), the third
    element is either the ``values`` to write on the record (commands create
    and update) either the new ``ids`` list of related records (command set),
    either 0 (commands delete, unlink, link, and clear).

    Via Python, we encourage developers craft new commands via the various
    functions of this namespace. We also encourage developers to use the
    command identifier constant names when comparing the 1st element of
    existing commands.

    Via RPC, it is impossible nor to use the functions nor the command constant
    names. It is required to instead write the literal 3-elements tuple where
    the first element is the integer identifier of the command.
