""" Domain expression processing

The main duty of this module is to compile a domain expression into a
SQL query. A lot of things should be documented here, but as a first
step in the right direction, some tests in test_expression.py
might give you some additional information.

For legacy reasons, a domain uses an inconsistent two-levels abstract
syntax (domains are regular Python data structures). At the first
level, a domain is an expression made of terms (sometimes called
leaves) and (domain) operators used in prefix notation. The available
operators at this level are '!', '&', and '|'. '!' is a unary 'not',
'&' is a binary 'and', and '|' is a binary 'or'.  For instance, here
is a possible domain. (<term> stands for an arbitrary term, more on
this later.)::

    ['&', '!', <term1>, '|', <term2>, <term3>]

It is equivalent to this pseudo code using infix notation::

    (not <term1>) and (<term2> or <term3>)

The second level of syntax deals with the term representation. A term
is a triple of the form (left, operator, right). That is, a term uses
an infix notation, and the available operators, and possible left and
right operands differ with those of the previous level. Here is a
possible term::

    ('company_id.name', '=', 'OpenERP')

The left and right operand don't have the same possible values. The
left operand is field name (related to the model for which the domain
applies).  Actually, the field name can use the dot-notation to
traverse relationships.  The right operand is a Python value whose
type should match the used operator and field type. In the above
example, a string is used because the name field of a company has type
string, and because we use the '=' operator. When appropriate, a 'in'
operator can be used, and thus the right operand should be a list.

Note: the non-uniform syntax could have been more uniform, but this
would hide an important limitation of the domain syntax. Say that the
term representation was ['=', 'company_id.name', 'OpenERP']. Used in a
complete domain, this would look like::

    ['!', ['=', 'company_id.name', 'OpenERP']]

and you would be tempted to believe something like this would be
possible::

    ['!', ['=', 'company_id.name', ['&', ..., ...]]]

That is, a domain could be a valid operand. But this is not the
case. A domain is really limited to a two-level nature, and can not
take a recursive form: a domain is not a valid second-level operand.

Unaccent - Accent-insensitive search

Odoo will use the SQL function 'unaccent' when available for the
'ilike', 'not ilike' and '=ilike' operators, and enabled in the configuration.

.. todo: The following explanation should be moved in some external
         installation guide

The steps to install the module might differ on specific PostgreSQL
versions.  We give here some instruction for PostgreSQL 9.x on a
Ubuntu system.

Ubuntu doesn't come yet with PostgreSQL 9.x, so an alternative package
source is used. We use Martin Pitt's PPA available at
`ppa:pitti/postgresql
<https://launchpad.net/~pitti/+archive/postgresql>`_.

.. code-block:: sh

    > sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pitti/postgresql
    > sudo apt-get update

Once the package list is up-to-date, you have to install PostgreSQL
9.0 and its contrib modules.

.. code-block:: sh

    > sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.0 postgresql-contrib-9.0

When you want to enable unaccent on some database:

.. code-block:: sh

    > psql9 <database> -f /usr/share/postgresql/9.0/contrib/unaccent.sql

Here :program:`psql9` is an alias for the newly installed PostgreSQL
9.0 tool, together with the correct port if necessary (for instance if
PostgreSQL 8.4 is running on 5432). (Other aliases can be used for
createdb and dropdb.)

.. code-block:: sh

    > alias psql9='/usr/lib/postgresql/9.0/bin/psql -p 5433'

You can check unaccent is working:

.. code-block:: sh

    > psql9 <database> -c"select unaccent('hélène')"

Finally, to instruct OpenERP to really use the unaccent function, you have to
start the server specifying the ``--unaccent`` flag.
