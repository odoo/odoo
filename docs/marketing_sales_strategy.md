# Marketing and Sales Strategy

## 1. Target Customers (Initial Focus)

- **Primary Target Segments:**
    - **Small to Medium-Sized Businesses (SMBs):** Companies with 10-250 employees who need an integrated platform to manage core operations, improve efficiency, and leverage data for growth. They often lack resources for custom-built solutions or complex enterprise software.
    - **Specific Verticals (Phase 1 or 2):** Initially, target general SMBs, then potentially focus on specific industries where the platform's value proposition is particularly strong (e.g., service-based businesses, e-commerce, small manufacturing). This will be informed by early adopter feedback.
    - **Tech-Savvy Teams/Departments within Larger Organizations:** Groups looking for a more agile and user-friendly solution than cumbersome corporate IT systems, particularly for project management, collaboration, or specific departmental functions.
- **Key User Personas (Examples):**
    - **Alex, the SMB Owner:** Juggles multiple roles, needs a centralized system to manage sales, projects, and customer interactions. Values ease of use, affordability, and good support.
    - **Maria, the Project Manager:** Needs tools for team collaboration, task tracking, and reporting. Values efficiency, visibility, and integration with other tools.
    - **David, the Sales Team Lead:** Wants to improve sales processes, track leads, and manage customer relationships effectively. Values CRM features, automation, and analytics.
