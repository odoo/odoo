- **Tiered Support:** Provide support levels that align with customer subscription tiers and needs.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review and update onboarding materials and support processes based on user feedback and platform changes.
- **Personalized Experience:** Tailor onboarding and support where possible to user roles and goals.
