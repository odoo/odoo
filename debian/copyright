  The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
  redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
  fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
  redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
  names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
  however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
  requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
  to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

    A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
    ==========================
    .
    Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
    Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
    as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
    principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
    .
    In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
    National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
    in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
    software.
    .
    In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
    BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
    year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
    Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
    Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
    non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
    Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
    the PSF.
    .
    All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
    the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
    releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
    the various releases.

    (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
        the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
        a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
        GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
        other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
    .
    (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
        because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
        CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
        is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
    .
    Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
    direction to make these releases possible.
