What is the job runner?
-----------------------
The job runner is the main process managing the dispatch of delayed jobs to
available Odoo workers

How does it work?
-----------------

* It starts as a thread in the Odoo main process
* It receives postgres NOTIFY messages each time jobs are
  added or updated in the queue_job table.
* It maintains an in-memory priority queue of jobs that
  is populated from the queue_job tables in all databases.
* It does not run jobs itself, but asks Odoo to run them through an
  anonymous ``/connector/runjob`` HTTP request. [1]_

How to use it?
--------------

* Set the following environment variables:

  - ``ODOO_CONNECTOR_CHANNELS=root:4`` (or any other channels configuration)
  - optional if ``xmlrpc_port`` is not set: ``ODOO_CONNECTOR_PORT=8069``

* Start Odoo with ``--load=web,web_kanban,connector``
  and ``--workers`` greater than 1. [2]_

* Confirm the runner is starting correctly by checking the odoo log file:

.. code-block:: none

  ...INFO...connector.jobrunner.runner: starting
  ...INFO...connector.jobrunner.runner: initializing database connections
  ...INFO...connector.jobrunner.runner: connector runner ready for db <dbname>
  ...INFO...connector.jobrunner.runner: database connections ready

* Create jobs (eg using base_import_async) and observe they
  start immediately and in parallel.

* Tip: to enable debug logging for the connector, use
  ``--log-handler=openerp.addons.connector:DEBUG``

Caveat
------

* After creating a new database or installing connector on an
  existing database, Odoo must be restarted for the runner to detect it.

* When Odoo shuts down normally, it waits for running jobs to finish.
  However, when the Odoo server crashes or is otherwise force-stopped,
  running jobs are interrupted while the runner has no chance to know
  they have been aborted. In such situations, jobs may remain in
  ``started`` or ``enqueued`` state after the Odoo server is halted.
  Since the runner has no way to know if they are actually running or
  not, and does not know for sure if it is safe to restart the jobs,
  it does not attempt to restart them automatically. Such stale jobs
  therefore fill the running queue and prevent other jobs to start.
  You must therefore requeue them manually, either from the Jobs view,
  or by running the following SQL statement *before starting Odoo*:

.. code-block:: sql

  update queue_job set state='pending' where state in ('started', 'enqueued')

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [1] From a security standpoint, it is safe to have an anonymous HTTP
       request because this request only accepts to run jobs that are
       enqueued.
.. [2] It works with the threaded Odoo server too, although this way
       of running Odoo is obviously not for production purposes.
