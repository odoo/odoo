-
    Exercise ir_rule.py code (and indirectly expression.py).
-
    Create an ir_rule for the Employee group (called base.group_user)
    with an blank domain.
-
    !record {model: ir.rule, id: test_rule}:
        model_id: base.model_res_partner
        domain_force: False
        name: test_rule
        groups:
            - base.group_user
        perm_unlink: 1
        perm_write: 1
        perm_read: 1
        perm_create: 1
-
    Read as demo user the partners (one blank domain).
-
    !python {model: res.partner }: |
        ids = self.search(cr, ref('base.user_demo'), [])
        assert ids, "Demo user should see some partner."
-
    Domain is not empty.
-
    !record {model: ir.rule, id: test_rule}:
        model_id: base.model_res_partner
        domain_force: "[(1,'=',1)]"
-
    Read as demo user the partners (one 1=1 domain).
-
    !python {model: res.partner }: |
        ids = self.search(cr, ref('base.user_demo'), [])
        assert ids, "Demo user should see some partner."
-
    Domain is an empty list.
-
    !record {model: ir.rule, id: test_rule}:
        model_id: base.model_res_partner
        domain_force: "[]"
-
    Read as demo user the partners (one [] domain).
-
    !python {model: res.partner }: |
        ids = self.search(cr, ref('base.user_demo'), [])
        assert ids, "Demo user should see some partner."
-
    Create another ir_rule for the Employee group (to test rules from
    multiple groups).
-
    !record {model: ir.rule, id: test_rule2}:
        model_id: base.model_res_partner
        domain_force: False
        name: test_rule2
        groups:
            - base.group_user
        perm_unlink: 1
        perm_write: 1
        perm_read: 1
        perm_create: 1
-
    Read as demo user the partners (blank and [] domains).
-
    !python {model: res.partner }: |
        ids = self.search(cr, ref('base.user_demo'), [])
        assert ids, "Demo user should see some partner."
-
    Domain is not empty.
-
    !record {model: ir.rule, id: test_rule}:
        model_id: base.model_res_partner
        domain_force: "[(1,'=',1)]"
-
    Read as demo user the partners (1=1 and blank domain).
-
    !python {model: res.partner }: |
        ids = self.search(cr, ref('base.user_demo'), [])
        assert ids, "Demo user should see some partner."
-
    Domain is not empty.
-
    !record {model: ir.rule, id: test_rule2}:
        model_id: base.model_res_partner
        domain_force: "[(1,'=',1)]"
-
    Read as demo user the partners (two 1=1 domains).
-
    !python {model: res.partner }: |
        ids = self.search(cr, ref('base.user_demo'), [])
        assert ids, "Demo user should see some partner."
-
    Create another ir_rule for the Employee group (to test rules from
    multiple groups).
-
    !record {model: ir.rule, id: test_rule3}:
        model_id: base.model_res_partner
        domain_force: False
        name: test_rule3
        groups:
            - base.group_user
        perm_unlink: 1
        perm_write: 1
        perm_read: 1
        perm_create: 1
-
    Read as demo user the partners.
-
    !python {model: res.partner }: |
        ids = self.search(cr, ref('base.user_demo'), [])
        assert ids, "Demo user should see some partner."
-
    Domain is not empty.
-
    !record {model: ir.rule, id: test_rule3}:
        model_id: base.model_res_partner
        domain_force: "[(1,'=',1)]"
-
    Read as demo user the partners (three 1=1 domains).
-
    !python {model: res.partner }: |
        ids = self.search(cr, ref('base.user_demo'), [])
        assert ids, "Demo user should see some partner."
-
    Modify the global rule on res_company which triggers a recursive check
    of the rules on company.
-
    !record {model: ir.rule, id: base.res_company_rule}:
        domain_force: "[('id','child_of',[user.company_id.id])]"
-
    Read as demo user the partners (exercising the global company rule).
-
    !python {model: res.partner }: |
        ids = self.search(cr, ref('base.user_demo'), [])
        assert ids, "Demo user should see some partner."
-
    Modify the ir_rule for employee so that demo is not
    allowed to see partners anymore. We use a domain
    with implicit AND operator for later tests on normalization.
-
    !record {model: ir.rule, id: test_rule2}:
        domain_force: "[('id','=',False),('name','=',False)]"
-
    Check that demo user does not see partners anymore.
-
    !python {model: res.partner }: |
        ids = self.search(cr, ref('base.user_demo'), [])
        assert (not ids), "Demo user should not see any partner anymore"
-
    Create a new group with demo user in it, and a complex  rule that should
    re-allow demo to see partners, because he belongs to both groups.
-
    !record {model: res.groups, id: test_group}:
        name: Test Group
        users:
            - base.user_demo
-
    Add the rule to the new group, with a domain containing an implicit AND operator,
    which is more tricky because it will have to be normalized before combining it.
-
    !record {model: ir.rule, id: test_rule3}:
        model_id: base.model_res_partner
        domain_force: "[('name', '!=', False),('id', '!=', False)]"
        name: test_rule4
        groups:
            - test_group
        perm_unlink: 1
        perm_write: 1
        perm_read: 1
        perm_create: 1
-
    Read the partners again as demo user, which should give results again.
-
    !python {model: res.partner }: |
        ids = self.search(cr, ref('base.user_demo'), [])
        assert ids, "Demo user should see some partners again, due to combined rules."
-
    Delete global domains (to combine only group domains).
-
    !python {model: ir.rule}: |
        ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('groups','=',False)])
        assert ids, "Demo user should see some partner."
        self.unlink(cr, uid, ids)
-
    Read as demo user the partners (several group domains, no global domain).
-
    !python {model: res.partner }: |
        ids = self.search(cr, ref('base.user_demo'), [])
        assert ids, "Demo user should see some partner."
