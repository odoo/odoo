==============
Sale Exception
==============

This module allows you attach several customizable exceptions to your
sale order in a way that you can filter orders by exceptions type and fix them.

This is especially useful in an scenario for mass sales order import such as 
with the base_sale_multi_channels module, because it's likely some orders have
errors when you import them (like product not found in Odoo, wrong line
format etc.)
