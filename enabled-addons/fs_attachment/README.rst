In some cases, you need to store attachment in another system that the
Odoo's filestore. For example, when your deployment is based on a
multi-server architecture to ensure redundancy and scalability, your
attachments must be stored in a way that they are accessible from all
the servers. In this way, you can use a shared storage system like NFS
or a cloud storage like S3 compliant storage, or....

This addon extend the storage mechanism of Odoo's attachments to allow
you to store them in any storage filesystem supported by the Python
library `fsspec <https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
and made available via the fs_storage addon.

In contrast to Odoo, when a file is stored into an external storage,
this addon ensures that the filename keeps its meaning (In odoo the
filename into the filestore is the file content checksum). Concretely
the filename is based on the pattern:
'<name-without-extension>-<attachment-id>-<version>.<extension>'

This addon also adds on the attachments 2 new fields to use to retrieve
the file content from a URL:

- ``Internal URL``: URL to retrieve the file content from the Odoo's
  filestore.
- ``Filesystem URL``: URL to retrieve the file content from the external
  storage.

Note

The internal URL is always available, but the filesystem URL is only
available when the attachment is stored in an external storage.
Particular attention has been paid to limit as much as possible the
consumption of resources necessary to serve via Odoo the content stored
in an external filesystem. The implementation is based on an end-to-end
streaming of content between the external filesystem and the Odoo client
application by default. Nevertheless, if your content is available via a
URL on the external filesystem, you can configure the storage to use the
x-sendfile mechanism to serve the content if it's activated on your Odoo
instance. In this case, the content served by Odoo at the internal URL
will be proxied to the filesystem URL by nginx.

Last but not least, the addon adds a new method open on the attachment.
This method allows you to open the attachment as a file. For attachments
stored into the filestore or in an external filesystem, it allows you to
directly read from and write to the file and therefore minimize the
memory consumption since data are not kept into memory before being
written into the database.

Usage
=====

Configuration
-------------

The configuration is done through the creation of a filesytem storage
record into odoo. To create a new storage, go to the menu
``Settings > Technical > FS Storage`` and click on ``Create``.

In addition to the common fields available to configure a storage,
specifics fields are available under the section 'Attachment' to
configure the way attachments will be stored in the filesystem.

- ``Optimizes Directory Path``: This option is useful if you need to
  prevent having too many files in a single directory. It will create a
  directory structure based on the attachment's checksum (with 2 levels
  of depth) For example, if the checksum is ``123456789``, the file will
  be stored in the directory ``/path/to/storage/12/34/my_file-1-0.txt``.

- ``Autovacuum GC``: This is used to automatically remove files from the
  filesystem when it's no longer referenced in Odoo. Some storage
  backends (like S3) may charge you for the storage of files, so it's
  important to remove them when they're no longer needed. In some cases,
  this option is not desirable, for example if you're using a storage
  backend to store images shared with others systems (like your website)
  and you don't want to remove the files from the storage while they're
  still referenced into the others systems. This mechanism is based on a
  ``fs.file.gc`` model used to collect the files to remove. This model
  is automatically populated by the ``ir.attachment`` model when a file
  is removed from the database. If you disable this option, you'll have
  to manually take care of the records in the ``fs.file.gc`` for your
  filesystem storage.

- ``Use As Default For Attachment``: This options allows you to declare
  the storage as the default one for attachments. If you have multiple
  filesystem storage configured, you can choose which one will be used
  by default for attachments. Once activated, attachments created
  without specifying a storage will be stored in this default storage.

- ``Force DB For Default Attachment Rules``: This option is useful if
  you want to force the storage of some attachments in the database,
  even if you have a default filesystem storage configured. This is
  specially useful when you're using a storage backend like S3, where
  the latency of the network can be high. This option is a JSON field
  that allows you to define the mimetypes and the size limit below which
  the attachments will be stored in the database.

  Small images (128, 256) are used in Odoo in list / kanban views. We
  want them to be fast to read. They are generally < 50KB (default
  configuration) so they don't take that much space in database, but
  they'll be read much faster than from the object storage.

  The assets (application/javascript, text/css) are stored in database
  as well whatever their size is:

  - a database doesn't have thousands of them
  - of course better for performance
  - better portability of a database: when replicating a production
    instance for dev, the assets are included

  The default configuration is:

     {"image/": 51200, "application/javascript": 0, "text/css": 0}

     Where the key is the beginning of the mimetype to configure and the
     value is the limit in size below which attachments are kept in DB.
     0 means no limit.

  Default configuration means:

  - images mimetypes (image/png, image/jpeg, ...) below 50KB are stored
    in database
  - application/javascript are stored in database whatever their size
  - text/css are stored in database whatever their size

  This option is only available on the filesystem storage that is used
  as default for attachments.

It is also possible to use different FS storages for attachments linked
to different resource fields/models. You can configure it either on the
``fs.storage`` directly, or in a server environment file:

- From the ``fs.storage``: Fields model_ids and field_ids will encode
  for which models/fields use this storage as default storage for
  attachments having these resource model/field. Note that if an
  attachment has both resource model and field, it will first take the
  FS storage where the field is explicitely linked, then is not found,
  the one where the model is explicitely linked.
- From a server environment file: In this case you just have to provide
  a comma-separated list of models (under the model_xmlids key) or
  fields (under the field_xmlids key). To do so, use the model/field XML
  ids provided by Odoo. See the Server Environment section for a
  concrete example.

Another key feature of this module is the ability to get access to the
attachments from URLs.

- ``Base URL``: This is the base URL used to access the attachments from
  the filesystem storage itself. If your storage doesn't provide a way
  to access the files from a URL, you can leave this field empty.

- ``Is Directory Path In URL``: Normally the directory patch configured
  on the storage is not included in the URL. If you want to include it,
  you can activate this option.

- ``Use X-Sendfile To Serve Internal Url``: If checked and odoo is
  behind a proxy that supports x-sendfile, the content served by the
  attachment's internal URL will be served by the proxy using the
  filesystem url path if defined (This field is available on the
  attachment if the storage is configured with a base URL) If not, the
  file will be served by odoo that will stream the content read from the
  filesystem storage. This option is useful to avoid to serve files from
  odoo and therefore to avoid to load the odoo process.

  To be fully functional, this option requires the proxy to support
  x-sendfile (apache) or x-accel-redirect (nginx). You must also
  configure your proxy by adding for each storage a rule to redirect the
  url rooted at the 'storagge code' to the server serving the files. For
  example, if you have a storage with the code 'my_storage' and a server
  serving the files at the url 'http://myserver.com', you must add the
  following rule in your proxy configuration:

  .. code:: nginx

     location /my_storage/ {
         internal;
         proxy_pass http://myserver.com;
     }

  With this configuration a call to
  '/web/content/<att.id>/<att.name><att.extension>" for a file stored in
  the 'my_storage' storage will generate a response by odoo with the URI
  ``/my_storage/<paht_in_storage>/<att.name>-<att.id>-<version><att.extension>``
  in the headers ``X-Accel-Redirect`` and ``X-Sendfile`` and the proxy
  will redirect to
  ``http://myserver.com/<paht_in_storage>/<att.name>-<att.id>-<version><att.extension>``.

  see
  https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/x-accel/
  for more information.

- ``Use Filename Obfuscation``: If checked, the filename used to store
  the content into the filesystem storage will be obfuscated. This is
  useful to avoid to expose the real filename of the attachments outside
  of the Odoo database. The filename will be obfuscated by using the
  checksum of the content. This option is to avoid when the content of
  your filestore is shared with other systems (like your website) and
  you want to keep a meaningful filename to ensure SEO. This option is
  disabled by default.

Server Environment
------------------

When you configure a storage through the use of server environment file,
you can provide values for the following keys:

- ``optimizes_directory_path``
- ``autovacuum_gc``
- ``base_url``
- ``is_directory_path_in_url``
- ``use_x_sendfile_to_serve_internal_url``
- ``use_as_default_for_attachments``
- ``force_db_for_default_attachment_rules``
- ``use_filename_obfuscation``
- ``model_xmlids``
- ``field_xmlids``

For example, the configuration of my storage with code fsprod used to
store the attachments by default could be:

.. code:: ini

   [fs_storage.fsprod]
   protocol=s3
   options={"endpoint_url": "https://my_s3_server/", "key": "KEY", "secret": "SECRET"}
   directory_path=my_bucket
   use_as_default_for_attachments=True
   use_filename_obfuscation=True
   model_xmlids=base.model_res_lang,base.model_res_country
   field_xmlids=base.field_res_partner__image_128

Advanced usage: Using attachment as a file
------------------------------------------

The open method on the attachment can be used to open manipulate the
attachment as a file object. The object returned by the call to the
method implements methods from ``io.IOBase``. The method can ba called
as any other python method. In such a case, it's your responsibility to
close the file at the end of your process.

.. code:: python

   attachment = self.env.create({"name": "test.txt"})
   the_file = attachment.open("wb")
   try:
     the_file.write(b"content")
   finally:
     the_file.close()

The result of the call to open also works in a context ``with`` block.
In such a case, when the code exit the block, the file is automatically
closed.

.. code:: python

   attachment = self.env.create({"name": "test.txt"})
   with attachment.open("wb") as the_file:
     the_file.write(b"content")

It's always safer to prefer the second approach.

When your attachment is stored into the odoo filestore or into an
external filesystem storage, each time you call the open method, a new
file is created. This way of doing ensures that if the transaction is
rolled back the original content is preserved. Nevertheless you could
have use cases where you would like to write to the existing file
directly. For example you could create an empty attachment to store a
csv report and then use the open method to write your content directly
into the new file. To support this kind a use cases, the parameter
new_version can be passed as False to avoid the creation of a new file.

.. code:: python

   attachment = self.env.create({"name": "test.txt"})
   with attachment.open("w", new_version=False) as f:
       writer = csv.writer(f, delimiter=";")
       ....

Tips & Tricks
-------------

- When working in multi staging environments, the management of the
  attachments can be tricky. For example, if you have a production
  instance and a staging instance based on a backup of the production
  environment, you may want to have the attachments shared between the
  two instances BUT you don't want to have one instance removing or
  modifying the attachments of the other instance.

  To do so, you can add on your staging instances a new storage and
  declare it as the default storage to use for attachments. This way,
  all the new attachments will be stored in this new storage but the
  attachments created on the production instance will still be read from
  the production storage. Be careful to adapt the configuration of your
  storage to the production environment to make it read only. (The use
  of server environment files is a good way to do so).

- When enabling ``Use As Default For Attachment`` you must be aware that
  this option applies from the point when the ``fs_attachment`` has been
  loaded by Odoo. This means that some attachments (such as icons)
  created during the update of modules that are loaded before
  ``fs_attachment`` will still be stored in the location defined in the
  ``ir_attachment.location`` system parameter (which is ``file`` by
  default, meaning the regular on-disk ``filestore`` directory).

  A simple way to work around this issue is to set the
  ``ir_attachment.location`` System Parameter record to ``db``.

Changelog
=========

18.0.2.2.0 (2025-10-20)
-----------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Adapt to handle {db_name} in directory_path.
  (`#db_name <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/db_name>`__)

18.0.1.1.0 (2024-11-10)
-----------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- No crash o missign file.

  Prior to this change, Odoo was crashing as soon as access to a file
  stored into an external filesytem was not possible. This can lead to a
  complete system block. This change prevents this kind of blockage by
  ignoring access error to files stored into external system on read
  operations. These kind of errors are logged into the log files for
  traceability. (`#361 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/361>`__)

16.0.1.0.8 (2023-12-20)
-----------------------

**Bugfixes**

- Fix the error retrieving attachment files when the storage is set to
  optimize directory paths.
  (`#312 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/312>`__)

16.0.1.0.6 (2023-12-02)
-----------------------

**Bugfixes**

- Improve performance at creation of an attachment or when the
  attachment is updated.

  Before this change, when the fs_url was computed the computed value
  was always reassigned to the fs_url attribute even if the value was
  the same. In a lot of cases the value was the same and the
  reassignment was not necessary. Unfortunately this reassignment has as
  side effect to mark the record as dirty and generate a SQL update
  statement at the end of the transaction.
  (`#307 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/307>`__)

16.0.1.0.5 (2023-11-29)
-----------------------

**Bugfixes**

- When manipulating the file system api through a local variable named
  *fs*, we observed some strange behavior when it was wrongly redefined
  in an enclosing scope as in the following example: *with fs.open(...)
  as fs*. This commit fixes this issue by renaming the local variable
  and therefore avoiding the name clash.
  (`#306 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/306>`__)

16.0.1.0.4 (2023-11-22)
-----------------------

**Bugfixes**

  users with basic access
  (`#289 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/289>`__)

16.0.1.0.2 (2023-10-09)
-----------------------

**Bugfixes**

- Ensures python 3.9 compatibility.
  (`#285 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/285>`__)
- If a storage is not used to store all the attachments by default, the
  call to the get_force_db_for_default_attachment_rules method must
  return an empty dictionary.
