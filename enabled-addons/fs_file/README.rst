This addon defines a new field type FSFile which is a file field that
stores a file in an external filesystem instead of the odoo's filestore.
This is useful for large files that you don't want to store in the
filestore. Moreover, the field value provides you an interface to access
the file's contents and metadata.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

The new field **FSFile** has been developed to allows you to store files
in an external filesystem storage. Its design is based on the following
principles:

- The content of the file must be read from the filesystem only when
  needed.
- It must be possible to manipulate the file content as a stream by
  default.
- Unlike Odoo's Binary field, the content is the raw file content by
  default (no base64 encoding).
- To allows to exchange the file content with other systems, writing the
  content as base64 is possible. The read operation will return a json
  structure with the filename, the mimetype, the size and a url to
  download the file.

This design allows to minimize the memory consumption of the server when
manipulating large files and exchanging them with other systems through
the default jsonrpc interface.

Concretely, this design allows you to write code like this:

.. code:: python

   from IO import BytesIO
   from odoo import models, fields
   from odoo.addons.fs_file.fields import FSFile

   class MyModel(models.Model):
       _name = 'my.model'

       name = fields.Char()
       file = FSFile()

   # Create a new record with a raw content
   my_model = MyModel.create({
       'name': 'My File',
       'file': BytesIO(b"content"),
   })

   assert(my_model.file.read() == b"content")

   # Create a new record with a base64 encoded content
   my_model = MyModel.create({
       'name': 'My File',
       'file': b"content".encode('base64'),
   })
   assert(my_model.file.read() == b"content")

   # Create a new record with a file content
   my_model = MyModel.create({
       'name': 'My File',
       'file': open('my_file.txt', 'rb'),
   })
   assert(my_model.file.read() == b"content")
   assert(my_model.file.name == "my_file.txt")

   # create a record with a file content as base64 encoded and a filename
   # This method is useful to create a record from a file uploaded
   # through the web interface.
   my_model = MyModel.create({
       'name': 'My File',
       'file': {
           'filename': 'my_file.txt',
           'content': base64.b64encode(b"content"),
       },
   })
   assert(my_model.file.read() == b"content")
   assert(my_model.file.name == "my_file.txt")

   # write the content of the file as base64 encoded and a filename
   # This method is useful to update a record from a file uploaded
   # through the web interface.
   my_model.write({
       'file': {
           'name': 'my_file.txt',
           'file': base64.b64encode(b"content"),
       },
   })

   # the call to read() will return a json structure with the filename,
   # the mimetype, the size and a url to download the file.
   info = my_model.file.read()
   assert(info["file"] == {
       "filename": "my_file.txt",
       "mimetype": "text/plain",
       "size": 7,
       "url": "/web/content/1234/my_file.txt",
   })

   # use the field as a file stream
   # In such a case, the content is read from the filesystem without being
   # stored in memory.
   with my_model.file.open("rb) as f:
     assert(f.read() == b"content")

   # use the field as a file stream to write the content
   # In such a case, the content is written to the filesystem without being
   # stored in memory. This kind of approach is useful to manipulate large
   # files and to avoid to use too much memory.
   # Transactional behaviour is ensured by the implementation!
   with my_model.file.open("wb") as f:
       f.write(b"content")

Changelog
=========

16.0.1.0.6 (2024-02-23)
-----------------------

**Bugfixes**

- Fixes the creation of empty files.

  Before this change, the creation of empty files resulted in a
  constraint violation error. This was due to the fact that even if a
  name was given to the file it was not preserved into the FSFileValue
  object if no content was given. As result, when the corresponding
  ir.attachment was created in the database, the name was not set and
  the 'required' constraint was violated.
  (`#341 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/341>`__)

16.0.1.0.5 (2023-11-30)
-----------------------

**Bugfixes**

- Ensure the cache is properly set when a new value is assigned to a
  FSFile field. If the field is stored the value to the cache must be a
  FSFileValue object linked to the attachment record used to store the
  file. Otherwise the value must be one given since it could be the
  result of a compute method.
  (`#290 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/290>`__)

16.0.1.0.4 (2023-10-17)
-----------------------

**Bugfixes**

- Browse attachment with sudo() to avoid read access errors

  In models that have a multi fs image relation, a new line in form will
  trigger onchanges and will call the fs.file model 'convert_to_cache()'
  method that will try to browse the attachment with user profile that
  could have no read rights on attachment model.
  (`#288 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/288>`__)

16.0.1.0.3 (2023-10-05)
-----------------------

**Bugfixes**

- Fix the *mimetype* property on *FSFileValue* objects.

  The *mimetype* value is computed as follow:

  - If an attachment is set, the mimetype is taken from the attachment.
  - If no attachment is set, the mimetype is guessed from the name of
    the file.
  - If the mimetype cannot be guessed from the name, the mimetype is
    guessed from the content of the file.
    (`#284 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/284>`__)

16.0.1.0.1 (2023-09-29)
-----------------------

**Features**

- Add a *url_path* property on the *FSFileValue* object. This property
  allows you to easily get access to the relative path of the file on
  the filesystem. This value is only available if the filesystem storage
  is configured with a *Base URL* value.
  (`#281 <https://github.com/OCA/storage/issues/281>`__)

**Bugfixes**

- The *url_path*, *url* and *internal_url* properties on the
  *FSFileValue* object return *None* if the information is not available
  (instead of *False*).

  The *url* property on the *FSFileValue* object returns the filesystem
  url nor the url field of the attachment.
